      <description>&lt;article id="post-12934" class="post-12934 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; 	 	&lt;header class="entry-header"&gt; 		&lt;h1 class="entry-title"&gt;Flea Market, New Monkey&lt;/h1&gt;	&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-header --&gt;  	&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt; 		 &lt;p&gt;On Sunday, I started up the game to get some footage for a video I was working on. In particular, I needed footage of the flea market, my natural paths (under my green brick tiles, which I removed in some areas), and red turnips. I quickly spotted Joan, so I bought a red turnip seed for 1,000 bells. I then buried it, watered it, and later dug it up.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/accf-red-turnip-sm-150x84.jpg" alt="Look at that! I dug up a red turnip!" class="wp-image-12937" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Because I dug it up on the same day, it only sold for 2 bells. 😆 You&amp;#8217;re supposed to water it every day, and then sell it after a week for the full 16,000 bells. &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As for the flea market, I bought an orange chair from Clyde (566 bells), a red tie-dye from Midge (164 bells), and a mochi pestle from Ruby (552 bells). I was just being a good neighbor. 😛&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="278" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/accf-ruby-scratch-sm-150x83.jpg" alt="Ruby: I scratch your back, you scratch mine! ...But not too hard, li'l ears." class="wp-image-12936" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I also went home so that a villager could buy from me. Antonio showed up, and you can see what he bought in my video at the end of this entry.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I played again today, and Nana wanted me to catch her a giant snakehead! Those things are so rare, I knew I&amp;#8217;d never find it in time. So I had to decline her request. Sorry, Nana.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RUU_7981-sm-150x80.jpg" alt="Nana: Mint and I decided that it would be a good idea for me to have a pet giant snakehead!" class="wp-image-12938" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;When I ran into Clyde, he told me that he&amp;#8217;s been thinking of moving out of town. He&amp;#8217;s only lived here about six weeks! But still, I didn&amp;#8217;t stop him from moving. He&amp;#8217;s not leaving immediately, but probably by next week.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RUU_7982-sm-150x80.jpg" alt="Clyde: Y'know, li'l guy, I've been thinking of moving out of Forest." class="wp-image-12939" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I was a bit confused when I went into a house in the northeast part of town. Monty was there, and he said it was nice to meet me. For one thing, he was already unpacked!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RUU_7983-sm-150x80.jpg" alt="Monty: Call me Monty! I just rolled into town and decided to stay, at least for a while." class="wp-image-12940" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;So that means he must&amp;#8217;ve moved in on Sunday, and I didn&amp;#8217;t notice his house. I do already have three other villagers in that little neighborhood, so it is easy to overlook somebody (especially when I didn&amp;#8217;t even know he was there). &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;But also, Monty is another returning villager. He lived in Forest from 2019-2020; I didn&amp;#8217;t care for him then, and I doubt I&amp;#8217;ll care for him now. 😆 &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I found Mint enjoying some coffee at the Roost. She was commenting on his shelves full of gyroids.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RUU_7985-sm-150x80.jpg" alt="Mint: Hmm. Ever notice that Brewster likes to decorate his shelves with gyroids?" class="wp-image-12941" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;In the city, Maple was enjoying the hustle and bustle of the city. Phineas was also there, as were Egbert, Bella, Elvis, and Pecan. (Phineas gave me an indigo balloon.)&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/RUU_7986-sm-150x80.jpg" alt="Maple: This is the best time of day to be in the city. Lots of hustle, lots of bustle, honey." class="wp-image-12942" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;By the way, my bank account balance just topped 63 million bells. So I&amp;#8217;m well on my way to meeting my summer goal, needing just about a million bells during August. I should have no trouble doing that, even though I didn&amp;#8217;t do any bug hunting today.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;A quick note about items: I found a garbage can in a balloon present on Sunday, and I found a stove in the recycle bin today.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;As for the video I mentioned earlier, it&amp;#8217;s a look at co-exclusive features in the Animal Crossing series. As you might expect, City Folk has a lot of features in common with Wild World, that don&amp;#8217;t appear in the other games. But you might not realize it also has a lot in common with New Leaf too! Check it out and see for yourself!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="What Each 2 Animal Crossing Games Have in Common (Co-Exclusive Features)" width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4N8PUlc5iRo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; 	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-content --&gt;  	 	&lt;footer class="entry-footer"&gt; 		&lt;span class="posted-on"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Posted on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/2024/08/03/flea-market-new-monkey/" rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;time class="entry-date published" datetime="2024-08-03T14:55:34-04:00"&gt;August 3, 2024&lt;/time&gt;&lt;time class="updated" datetime="2024-08-03T15:12:36-04:00"&gt;August 3, 2024&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="byline"&gt;&lt;span class="author vcard"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="url fn n" href="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/author/jvgsjeff/"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;			&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-footer --&gt;  &lt;/article&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;article id="post-7611" class="post-7611 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; 	&lt;header class="entry-header"&gt; 		&lt;h1 class="entry-title"&gt;New Pig&amp;#8217;s Secret Plan&lt;/h1&gt;	&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-header --&gt;  	 	 	&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt; 		 &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, I received my monthly bank statement from town hall. I received 61,700 bells of interest for this past month. 💰&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I found a new house where Peanut recently lived (on the beach at the eastern wall). So Dotty&amp;#8217;s replacement has moved in, and my new neighbor is&amp;#8230;Truffles the pig.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" width="400" height="299" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/truffles-150x112.jpg" alt="Truffles: Hi there! I'm Truffles!" class="wp-image-7612" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;She&amp;#8217;s definitely not the cutest villager around, but she seems nice so far.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Octavian pinged me and said we should have a secret-friend password. He suggested that I say &amp;#8220;freaky,&amp;#8221; and he responds with &amp;#8220;sasquatch.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="299" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/octavian-freaky-150x112.jpg" alt="Octavian: Like you say, freaky, and I say sasquatch..." class="wp-image-7613" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I guess I wasn&amp;#8217;t fully paying attention, because I thought he was asking for a catchphrase, not a greeting. So I told him to say &amp;#8220;freaky,&amp;#8221; since I thought that was one of his suggestions&amp;#8230;and he said it sounded weird to him. 😆&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="299" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/octavian-weird-150x112.jpg" alt="Octavian: Freaky! ...Whoa. Sounds kinda weird to me." class="wp-image-7614" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;Well you suggested it! Even if it was supposed to be &lt;em&gt;my &lt;/em&gt;line, not yours.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today, I visited Truffles and she reminded me that the first fireworks festival of the year is tomorrow night.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="299" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/truffles-fireworks-150x112.jpg" alt="Truffles: Tomorrow! The Fireworks Show is TOMORROW, snoutie!" class="wp-image-7615" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Wild World actually has five fireworks festivals this year! Unfortunately, the later games only have four again (since there are only four Sundays in August this year, but five Saturdays).&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, Truffles told me her secret plan to get close to cute boys during the show. She said that since the fireworks are so loud, she can&amp;#8217;t hear what the boy is saying&amp;#8230;so she has a good excuse to scoot closer and closer.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="299" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acwwblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/truffles-closer-150x112.jpg" alt="Truffles: So, you scoot a li'l closer to him. And a li'l closer..." class="wp-image-7616" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 85vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Consequently, I don&amp;#8217;t plan on playing this weekend. 😆 She&amp;#8217;ll have to scoot closer to someone else. 😛 &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Eloise is my latest villager to get sick with a cold, so I gave her a dose of medicine. Get well soon!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;At town hall, I found a blue table in the recycle bin.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Have you ever thought about what Wild World has in common with each of the other Animal Crossing games? It has the most in common with City Folk, of course, but it also has some co-exclusive features with the other games too. Please check out my latest video, which is my 1,000th Youtube video, to find out more:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="What Each 2 Animal Crossing Games Have in Common (Co-Exclusive Features)" width="840" height="473" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4N8PUlc5iRo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ll be back with another entry next week.

      <description>&lt;article id="post-8245" class="post-8245 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; 	 	&lt;header class="entry-header"&gt; 		&lt;h1 class="entry-title"&gt;Bugs, Birthdays, and Don&lt;/h1&gt;	&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-header --&gt;  	&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt; 		 &lt;p&gt;The Bug-Off was held last Saturday, and I participated (but just in one round). I caught 11 bugs in the three-minute time limit, with the last one being a long locust I caught with three seconds remaining. As time expired, my net promptly exploded in my hands. 😛&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bug-off-net-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Bug-Off is over!" class="wp-image-8248" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Flick confirmed that my 11 bugs netted me 13 points. I used ten of those points to score a butterfly backpack.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;It was also Ketchup&amp;#8217;s birthday, so I made sure to attend her party. Louie was also there to help her celebrate. I gave Ketchup some stacked bags that I customized to be green. Happy birthday, Ketchup!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ketchup-bags-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Ketchup: Some stacked bags! I just KNEW you'd get me something great! I'll take good care of it!" class="wp-image-8249" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Monday, I found a scallop while diving&amp;#8230;and of course, Pascal popped up to ask for it. He then questioned why flower beds are called &amp;#8220;beds&amp;#8221; when the flowers seem awake to him. 🤷&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/pascal-flower-bed-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Pascal: Ever wonder why they call it a flower bed? They always seem real awake to me." class="wp-image-8250" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tuesday, Ankha told me she chooses her perfume based on the weather. So she said that she smells like apple, in her tomb. I&amp;#8217;m not sure any of that makes sense, because the weather wasn&amp;#8217;t &lt;em&gt;apple-ing&lt;/em&gt; outside.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/ankha-apple-tomb-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Ankha: For example, today I smell like apple, in my tomb." class="wp-image-8251" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, June kidnapped me and took me to her house. She, Static, and Ketchup had a surprise birthday party for me.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/bday2024-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Everyone: Happy birthday!" class="wp-image-8252" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I blew out my candles, smacked a piñata, got some birthday cupcakes, and received a gift (some birthday candles). Thanks, June, Ketchup, and Static!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/party2024-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Having fun at my birthday party with Ketchup, June, and Static." class="wp-image-8253" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today, I saw Don in the Roost. He said taking a cup of coffee for the road is great, except that he usually ends up spilling it if he&amp;#8217;s with Sonny (aka Resetti).&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/don2-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Don: But when we get the call and I'm with Sonny?

Slider performed K.K. Chorinho for me on Sunday.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;K.K. also showed up Wednesday to play K.K. Birthday.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Label wanted to see me in an outdoorsy outfit today, and she gave me a music-fest shirt as an example. I kept the clothes I was already wearing, but added a baseball cap. Label liked it, but it wasn&amp;#8217;t perfect. She gave me a Labelle hat.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/label-8224-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Label: Oh, wow!

Even the details are on point." class="wp-image-8256" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I recently posted a new video looking at some co-exclusive features in the Animal Crossing series. In other words, features that appeared in two games, but not the others. Each pair of games has something in common.

      <description>&lt;article id="post-17894" class="post-17894 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; 	 	&lt;header class="entry-header"&gt; 		&lt;h1 class="entry-title"&gt;Two Spades&lt;/h1&gt;	&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-header --&gt;  	&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt; 		 &lt;p&gt;On Saturday, I found Cube down on the beach. He was talking about the wind turbine, saying it spins so much that it makes him dizzy.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" width="400" height="240" src="https://www.jvgs.net/newleafblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240727_HNI_0051-250x150.jpg" alt="Cube: I can't star at it for too long, though, or I start to get dizzy. Ugh, my head hurts now, on Toy Day." class="wp-image-17895" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Except that the wind turbine was behind him, up on the cliff. He couldn&amp;#8217;t really see it from here unless he completely turned around and craned his neck up to the sky. 😛&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="240" src="https://www.jvgs.net/newleafblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240727_HNI_0052-250x150.jpg" alt="Cube standing underneath the wind turbine." class="wp-image-17896" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Yesterday, Inkwell asked for a new catchphrase to replace &amp;#8220;in the sea.&amp;#8221; I wanted his catchphrase to &lt;em&gt;stay fresh&lt;/em&gt;, so I told him to say &amp;#8220;in ink&amp;#8221; instead.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="240" src="https://www.jvgs.net/newleafblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240730_HNI_0060-250x150.jpg" alt="Inkwell: Hoo! The new me is gonna be irresistible, in ink!" class="wp-image-17897" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today, I was visiting Rolf, and Inkwell was also at his house. Not only was Rolf wearing a spade tee, but he also had one on display right behind him. ♠️&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="240" src="https://www.jvgs.net/newleafblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240731_HNI_0064-250x150.jpg" alt="Rolf and his spade tees." class="wp-image-17898" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I was even more amused when Inkwell seemingly made note of Rolf&amp;#8217;s new obsession. 😆&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="240" src="https://www.jvgs.net/newleafblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240731_HNI_0066-250x150.jpg" alt="Inkwell: I bet he loves his spade tee!" class="wp-image-17899" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Maybe Rolf will let us join his &lt;em&gt;spade club&lt;/em&gt; if we play our cards right. 😉&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Gulliver was down on the beach talking about the Manneken Pis and chocolate. So I knew he was headed to Belgium&amp;#8230;and he&amp;#8217;ll send me a gift from there.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="240" src="https://www.jvgs.net/newleafblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240731_HNI_0069-250x150.jpg" alt="Gulliver: ...Belgium!" class="wp-image-17900" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I went down to the beach for a summer night fishing/bug-hunting expedition. Even though I do this more in City Folk, it can be fun in the other games as well. After spending about 40 minutes on the beach, I had a pretty nice haul: I caught four ocean sunfish, three regular sharks, two hammerhead sharks, a Napoleonfish, two horned atlases, three goliath beetles, two cyclommatus stags, and a horned elephant. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="240" src="https://www.jvgs.net/newleafblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240731_HNI_0072-250x150.jpg" alt="I caught an ocean sunfish! My day is brighter already! 114.50 in." class="wp-image-17901" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I made around 160k, give or take, although I&amp;#8217;m not sure of the exact amount. Regardless, it was enough to bump up my savings account balance to 130 million bells!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="400" height="240" src="https://www.jvgs.net/newleafblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/20240731_HNI_0073-250x150.jpg" alt="Your current balance is 130,000,000 bells." class="wp-image-17902" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today, I posted a new video taking a look at &amp;#8220;co-exclusive features&amp;#8221; in the Animal Crossing series. Basically, features that are in two of the core Animal Crossing games, but not the others. Like igloos are only in New Leaf and the GameCube game, or hide-and-seek is only in City Folk and New Leaf. I hope you&amp;#8217;ll give the video a watch, and maybe learn something new about the series! 🙂&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"&gt;&lt;div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper"&gt; &lt;iframe loading="lazy" title="What Each 2 Animal Crossing Games Have in Common (Co-Exclusive Features)" width="660" height="371" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4N8PUlc5iRo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;    &lt;p&gt;See you all in August!&lt;/p&gt; 	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-content --&gt;  	 	&lt;footer class="entry-footer"&gt; 		&lt;span class="posted-on"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Posted on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jvgs.net/newleafblog/2024/07/31/two-spades/" rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;time class="entry-date published" datetime="2024-07-31T23:55:00-04:00"&gt;July 31, 2024&lt;/time&gt;&lt;time class="updated" datetime="2024-08-01T00:04:01-04:00"&gt;August 1, 2024&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="byline"&gt;&lt;span class="author vcard"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="url fn n" href="https://www.jvgs.net/newleafblog/author/jvgsjeff/"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;			&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-footer --&gt;  &lt;/article&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;article id="post-12923" class="post-12923 post type-post status-publish format-standard hentry category-uncategorized"&gt; 	 	&lt;header class="entry-header"&gt; 		&lt;h1 class="entry-title"&gt;Title Screen Tease&lt;/h1&gt;	&lt;/header&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-header --&gt;  	&lt;div class="entry-content"&gt; 		 &lt;p&gt;I turned on the game Wednesday, and I noticed something interesting on the title screen: In front of Curly&amp;#8217;s house, I saw Wisp&amp;#8217;s empty lamp. (Unfortunately, I hadn&amp;#8217;t started recording footage yet.) But when I actually started the game up, the lamp wasn&amp;#8217;t there. In fact, I didn&amp;#8217;t find it &lt;em&gt;anywhere &lt;/em&gt;in town. It was too early in the day for Wisp himself to show up, though.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;So I tried again after 8 p.m., but I still found no sign of Wisp or his lamp. It was raining, and I wondered if that contributed (though I didn&amp;#8217;t think it would). But in the meantime, I caught some bugs and fish&amp;#8230;including two coelacanths! Nice!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img fetchpriority="high" width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RUU_7978-sm-150x80.jpg" alt="A coelacanth?" class="wp-image-12928" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;The rain stopped at 11 p.m., and I again took another walk around town. No Wisp, and no empty lamp. I guess Wisp ghosted me. 😛 So naturally, I have some questions. Is evidence of a special character on the title screen not indicative of what happens once the game starts up? Or what exactly happened that seemingly turned a Wisp day into &lt;em&gt;not &lt;/em&gt;a Wisp day? If anyone has any information, please let me know!&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Anyway, I found a surprise goodbye letter in the mail from Grizzly. He has been in Forest since &lt;a href="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/2022/09/24/three-cranky-bears/"&gt;September 2022&lt;/a&gt;, which made him my longest-tenured villager. (I believe Roscoe now holds that title.) Even though I wasn&amp;#8217;t thrilled about Grizzly when he first arrived, he has grown on me in the past two years. So I&amp;#8217;m a bit sad to see him go.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RUU_7977-sm-150x80.jpg" alt="Jeff, Thanks for being here for me. I'm a better animal for knowing you. I'm leaving Forest behind, but I'll be thinking of you in my new home! -Grizzly" class="wp-image-12927" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;For the day, I made nearly 200,000 bells.&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Today, it was raining in town again, and Midge thought the trees and flowers looked happier because of it.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="281" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/accf-midge-rain-150x84.jpg" alt="Midge: All the trees and flowers look so much happier when it's raining, don't you agree, I eat bugs?" class="wp-image-12925" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;figcaption class="wp-element-caption"&gt;I agree you eat bugs.&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Clyde wanted to take a break from the rain at the Roost. But he changed his mind when he realized he forgot to bring his sugar stash. Seems like the Roost should provide sugar for the coffee they serve!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RUU_7979-sm-150x80.jpg" alt="Clyde: Oh, but I forgot to bring my sugar stash, clip clawp..." class="wp-image-12929" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Tonight, I went to the Roost myself to check out the Saturday night show. K.K. performed K.K. Jazz for me. It&amp;#8217;s not my favorite, but I guess it&amp;#8217;s okay.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="500" height="268" src="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/RUU_7980-sm-150x80.jpg" alt="K.K.: All right, get ready to dig the riffs on this ditty: K.K. Jazz." class="wp-image-12930" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I spent a few minutes bug hunting, but not too long. I wasn&amp;#8217;t finding many great bugs (maybe one cyclommatus and one goliath beetle). It&amp;#8217;s probably because it was only around 9:00, and some of the better bugs don&amp;#8217;t come out until 11:00.&lt;/p&gt; 	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-content --&gt;  	 	&lt;footer class="entry-footer"&gt; 		&lt;span class="posted-on"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Posted on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/2024/07/27/title-screen-tease/" rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;time class="entry-date published" datetime="2024-07-27T22:17:14-04:00"&gt;July 27, 2024&lt;/time&gt;&lt;time class="updated" datetime="2024-07-27T22:21:25-04:00"&gt;July 27, 2024&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="byline"&gt;&lt;span class="author vcard"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="url fn n" href="https://www.jvgs.net/accfblog/author/jvgsjeff/"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;			&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-footer --&gt;  &lt;/article&gt;</description>

So I said goodbye to my &amp;#8220;Zombies Ate My Neighbors&amp;#8221; outfit. 😛&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;On Monday, Curlos the sheep was camping in town. He also camped here &lt;a href="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/2023/07/04/two-pearls/"&gt;last summer&lt;/a&gt; too, but I&amp;#8217;m still not interested in him. &lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/curlos-camper2-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Curlos: Hey, you're a local, right?

In return, he gave me a dotted raincoat. (Not just a dot.) 😆&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/static-dot-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Static: I'm all better, thanks to you. So I'm hopin' you'll accept a small gift. It's a dot" class="wp-image-8236" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Today, I made a brief dream visit to the town of Skellige (dream address 1941-3363-3462). It&amp;#8217;s set in autumn, and it&amp;#8217;s beautiful!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/skellige2-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="The dream town of Skellige." class="wp-image-8237" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/skellige3-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="A waterfall in the beautiful town of Skellige." class="wp-image-8238" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;I even met my favorite ducky Molly there. 🥰&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/molly-dream-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Molly: I hope you enjoy yourself during your stay.

It&amp;#8217;s well worth a visit, so check it out for yourself if you&amp;#8217;d like!&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="wp-block-image"&gt; &lt;figure class="aligncenter size-full"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" src="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/skellige1-sm-250x141.jpg" alt="Some art in the town of Skellige." class="wp-image-8240" sizes="(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px" /&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Great work on the town, Kayla! &lt;/p&gt;    &lt;p&gt;Here are a few other quick notes about life back in Forest this week:&lt;/p&gt;    &lt;ul class="wp-block-list"&gt; &lt;li&gt;On Sunday, I asked Wisp for something expensive (for a change), and he gave me a fashionable royal dress.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Monday, I sold 20 fish (including &lt;em&gt;three &lt;/em&gt;ocean sunfish that I&amp;#8217;ve caught recently) to C.J. for 247,500 bells.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;I helped out Gulliver on Wednesday, and he sent me another geisha wig Thursday.&lt;/li&gt;    &lt;li&gt;Today, I sold Flick a total of 47 bugs for 363,750 bells. Nice haul!&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;    &lt;p&gt;See you all next time!&lt;/p&gt; 	&lt;/div&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-content --&gt;  	 	&lt;footer class="entry-footer"&gt; 		&lt;span class="posted-on"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Posted on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/2024/07/26/dreaming-of-skellige/" rel="bookmark"&gt;&lt;time class="entry-date published" datetime="2024-07-26T19:42:04-04:00"&gt;July 26, 2024&lt;/time&gt;&lt;time class="updated" datetime="2024-07-26T19:43:08-04:00"&gt;July 26, 2024&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="byline"&gt;&lt;span class="author vcard"&gt;&lt;span class="screen-reader-text"&gt;Author &lt;/span&gt;&lt;a class="url fn n" href="https://www.jvgs.net/acnhblog/author/jvgsjeff/"&gt;Jeff&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;			&lt;/footer&gt;&lt;!-- .entry-footer --&gt;  &lt;/article&gt;</description>

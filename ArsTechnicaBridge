Andrew's write-up got me thinking: When was the last time any Ars staffers actually burned an optical disc?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Lee Hutchinson, Senior Technology Editor&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It used to be one of the most common tasks I'd do with a computer. As a child of the '90s, my college years were spent filling and then lugging around &lt;a href="https://mashable.com/article/cd-binders"&gt;giant binders stuffed with home-burned CDs&lt;/a&gt; in my car to make sure I had exactly the right music on hand for any possible eventuality. The discs in these binders were all labeled with names like "METAL MIX XVIII" and "ULTRA MIX IV" and "MY MIX XIX," and part of the fun was trying to remember which songs I'd put on which disc. (There was always a bit of danger that I'd put on "CAR RIDE JAMS XV" to set the mood for a Friday night trip to the movies with all the boys, but I &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; have popped on "CAR RIDE JAMS XIV" because "CAR RIDE JAMS XV" opens with Britney Spears' "Lucky"—look, it's a &lt;em&gt;good song&lt;/em&gt;, and she &lt;em&gt;cries&lt;/em&gt; in her &lt;em&gt;lonely heart&lt;/em&gt;, OK?!—thus setting the stage for an evening of ridicule. Those were just the kinds of risks we took back in those ancient days.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It took a while to try to figure out what the very last time I burned a disc was, but I've narrowed it down to two possibilities. The first (and less likely) option is that the last disc I burned was a Windows 7 install disc because I've had a Windows 7 install disc sitting in a paper envelope on my shelf for so long that I can't remember how it got there. The label is in my handwriting, and it has a CD key written on it. Some quick searching shows I have the same CD key stored in 1Password with an "MSDN/Technet" label on it, which means I probably downloaded the image from good ol' &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_TechNet"&gt;TechNet&lt;/a&gt;, to which I maintained an active subscription for years until MS finally &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/07/microsoft-killing-off-technet-subscriptions/"&gt;killed the affordable version&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;But I think the &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; last disc I burned is still sitting in my car's CD changer. It's been in there so long that I'd completely forgotten about it, and it startled the crap out of me a few weeks back when I hopped in the car and accidentally pressed the "CD" button instead of the "USB" button. It's an MP3 CD instead of an audio CD, with about 120 songs on it, mostly picked from my iTunes "'80s/'90s" playlist. It's pretty eclectic, bouncing through a bunch of songs that were the backdrop of my teenage years—there's some Nena, some Stone Temple Pilots, some Michael Jackson, some Tool, some Stabbing Westward, some Natalie Merchant, and then the entire back half of the CD is just a giant block of like 40 Cure songs, probably because I got lazy and just started lasso-selecting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It turns out I left CDs the same way I came to them—with a giant mess of a mixtape.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Connor McInerney, Social Media Manager&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Like many people, physical media for me is deeply embedded with sentimentality; half the records in my vinyl collection are hand-me-downs from my parents, and every time I put one on, their aged hiss reminds me that my folks were once my age experiencing this music in the same way. This goes doubly so for CDs as someone whose teen years ended with the advent of streaming, and the last CD I burned is perhaps the most syrupy, saccharine example of this media you can imagine—it was a mixtape for the girl I was dating during the summer of 2013, right before we both went to college.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In hindsight this mix feels particularly of its time. I burned it using my MacBook Pro (the mid-2012 model was the last to feature a CD/DVD drive) and made the artwork by physically cutting and pasting a collage together (which I made the mix’s digital artwork by scanning and adding in iTunes). I still make mixes for people I care about using Spotify—and I often make custom artwork for said playlists with the help of Photoshop—but considering the effort that used to be required, the process feels unsurprisingly unsatisfying in comparison.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As for the musical contents of the mix, imagine what an 18-year-old Pitchfork reader was listening to in 2013 (Vampire Weekend, Postal Service, Fleet Foxes, Bon Iver, and anything else you might hear playing while shopping at an Urban Outfitters) and you’ve got a pretty close approximation.&lt;/p&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-content post-page"&gt;                                           &lt;h3&gt;John Timmer, Senior Science Editor&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's relatively easy to figure out the exact year I burned my last optical disk: It was the year Condé Nast bought Ars. I can never remember when that is, but it's easy to pull up by searching for "Condé buys Ars," which will reveal a bunch of articles on the news, all published in 2008. So we're over 16 years out since I last burned a DVD.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can piece that together because I remember exactly what I put on that DVD: all the photos taken during a trip to Australia and New Zealand. And I know that took place during the year or so between the end of my career as a scientist and starting full-time at Ars, when I was putting together an income from a bunch of different freelance efforts (writing, programming, grant editing, teaching, maybe other things?). As much as I thoroughly enjoyed my time in the Southern Hemisphere, I couldn't stop my brain from occasionally intruding with the reminder that, in contrast to all prior vacations I had taken, I wasn't earning anything while I was on this one. It didn't happen often, but it happened enough that it invariably comes to mind if I spend much time thinking about the trip.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Why did that trip get a DVD drive spinning? The combination of fantastic scenery and a DSLR meant I came home with lots of images. I wanted to safely archive all of them rather than try to squeeze it all onto my laptop's hard drive (I'm pretty sure that another set wound up on the Firewire hard drive I used for backups at the time, as well). So onto a DVD they went. A DVD that, to my knowledge, has never been re-inserted into a drive since, and I have only the vaguest idea of where I might find today. Laptop drives have since easily expanded to the point where all the photos happily sit where I can now access them with a couple of clicks, so I expect that's how it will remain.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;h3&gt;Kyle Orland, Senior Gaming Reporter&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Funny story: My last CD-R burn was actually to test out an unreleased prototype of a Dreamcast &lt;em&gt;Ecco the Dolphin&lt;/em&gt; game on actual hardware. I remember because I wrote about &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/play-a-new-official-ecco-the-dolphin-game-on-your-dreamcast-right-now/"&gt;the surprise 2016 release&lt;/a&gt; for Ars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Back in the early ‘00s, the ability to easily burn (ahem) "back up" copies of Dreamcast games did a lot to popularize and/or doom the system in a &lt;a href="https://medium.com/@michaelgapper/land-of-the-free-467f0eb2f395#.zf4qjp1kx"&gt;highly competitive console market&lt;/a&gt;. Today, that same lack of copy protection oversight makes it incredibly easy to play plenty of homebrew and/or abandonware software without the need for any special tools besides a CD-R drive. No console before or since has had so much software so easily available to any hardware owners, and it's all because of the humble CD-R.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Benj Edwards, Senior AI Reporter&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last CD-R I burned was probably a game for the Dreamcast a few years ago. People defeated that console's copy protection scheme long ago (during Dreamcast's lifetime), and every once in a while, I find a Dreamcast game I'd like to play but is difficult to get a copy of. Then it's time to fire up the ol' burner and make a copy from a special ISO. After playing the game for 15 minutes (i.e., &lt;em&gt;Sonic Shuffle&lt;/em&gt;), I'm satisfied that I've tried it, and it goes onto a CD spindle and onto a shelf where it will likely sit until I die. After that, my kids will probably throw it in a landfill. It's the circle of life.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Prior to that, I burned CDs of my own music to listen to in the car until I got rid of my only car with a CD player about three years ago. And occasionally I will burn a CD of some vintage Mac or MS-DOS software to transfer it to an old computer if it doesn't have a network card.)&lt;/p&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-content post-page"&gt;                                           &lt;h3&gt;Aaron Zimmerman, Copy Chief&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;I can’t remember the last disc I burned, but it was almost certainly a mix CD of some description. I’d like to think it was a compilation entitled “Silly Love Songs,” which I made for my wife, then girlfriend, when we were apart for a summer (the title track, of course, was Wings’ &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ap87QgZKTNw"&gt;song of the same name&lt;/a&gt;, and you should really only listen to it if you’re actively in love).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nowadays, of course, I do my DJing via Spotify playlists, but I often think about what a poorer experience it is. Certainly, you can discover music much easier on music-streaming services, and the process of adding a song you just discovered through an algorithm is dead simple. But that’s the problem. It’s too easy to throw together a list of great songs you’ve never heard before you started making your mix. Playlists are almost always ethereal and ultimately forgotten, if they’re ever “completed” at all. There’s no soul there!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But even mix CDs felt soulless when they came onto the scene. Before that, real heads know, we made mix&lt;em&gt;tapes&lt;/em&gt;. We’d painstakingly put together the perfect playlist, then sit by the stereo, transferring songs one by one to a cassette by pressing play + record. The accomplishment you’d feel as you handed your friend a freshly filled-up tape, complete with handwritten liner notes—that was pure joy, and a texted Spotify link has nothing on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Andrew Cunningham, Senior Technology Reporter&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The last disc I actually burned was probably for work a decade ago when everyone thought it would be very funny to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2014/09/my-coworkers-made-me-use-mac-os-9-for-their-and-your-amusement/"&gt;try to use Mac OS 9 as a work operating system&lt;/a&gt; for a day. The DVD drive (actually a combo CD burner/DVD reader from that awkward period after CD burners had gotten cheap but before DVD burners had) was still functional, and for the purposes of installing Mac OS 9, Mac OS X 10.4, and Mac OS X 10.5, burning a disc was more convenient and faster than trying to force the laptop to boot from one of its poky USB 1.1 ports.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;A lot of my post-high-school, post-iPod disc burning would probably have been operating system install discs. This was before legal, trustworthy ISOs of things like Windows 7 or Windows XP were freely available to download from Microsoft, so the savvy Windows installer would use programs like &lt;a href="https://nliteos.com/"&gt;nLite&lt;/a&gt; to slipstream new service packs and updates and automate parts of the setup process, creating an updated ISO that you could burn to a disc to save yourself time grabbing files from Windows Update over and over again.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's not something I miss now that Macs are restorable from the Internet and up-to-the-minute Windows ISOs can be grabbed directly from Microsoft's developer site. But when it came time to reinstall an OS for some reason, you were always glad to have that Maxell DVD-R with "WINDOWS 7 PRO X64 SP1 SLIPSTREAMED" Sharpied on it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Ashley Belanger, Senior Policy Reporter&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It should've been illegal for me to ever own CDs. I treated them terribly in high school, preferring to blast them in my car, then stuffing them in seat pockets and side doors, where they got scratched and warped in the Florida sun whenever I got bored with them. I inhaled music, skipping from disc to disc with a flick of my wrist, and I respected burned CDs least of all, knowing that I could easily just burn another copy. However, when I became a music journalist in the early aughts, burned CDs became more sacred, containing demos or live recordings of emerging bands that weren't easily recovered. I'd carefully shelve these discs in jewel cases and gingerly handle them when burning them for critics to review.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Very quickly, these burned CDs became relics, as MySpace and then Bandcamp made it easy to share music, but I'd always insist that my work laptop had to be able to rip CDs, right through 2016. Around that time, though, I transitioned from a music journalist to an investigative reporter, and I found out that fledgling bands weren't the only ones still burning CDs. Still into the 2020s, FOIA requests I sent to city and county government agencies would require a mailing address to obtain records burned on a CD-RW, then mailed to me. Sometimes they arrived damaged and useless. One of the last CD-Rs I received was from an agency in Cape Cod, Massachusetts, while I was researching septic tank vulnerabilities to sea level rise. I had to dig out an old laptop with a disc drive to review PDFs with appalling photos of sewage overflows and backups that burned into my memory. Perhaps this is the punishment I deserve for treating CDs so crappy as a kid?&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;h3&gt;Jonathan Gitlin, Senior Automotive Reporter&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would have been 2011. I was still working at NIH at the time, and I was out in San Diego for a week for a pair of conferences. The rental car—which I am pretty sure was a Toyota Camry—had no Bluetooth, and so I burned a CD of music to listen to while driving. I’m not sure what I did with the disc—I think I probably left it in the rental car at the airport.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Compared to the older days—I’m thinking the bad times of OS 8.5—it was a doddle to create (or find) a playlist in iTunes, then insert a blank disc, and then drag it to the trash, which changed icon to become a radioactivity symbol. Or perhaps the yellow and black warning sign showed up in iTunes itself? It’s been more than a decade, so I’m allowed to be a bit hazy on the topic.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Nowadays I’m not even sure I have the capability to repeat that feat. Neither the M1 nor Intel MBPs in the house have an optical drive, and neither my wife nor I knows where to find the old USB-A drive she bought years ago. A shame really, since I found a whole spindle of unused DVD-Rs in the basement the other week…&lt;/p&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-content post-page"&gt;                                      &lt;figure class="intro-image intro-left"&gt;   &lt;img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/billgross-800x534.jpg" alt="One startup’s plan to fix AI’s “shoplifting” problem"&gt;       &lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/billgross.jpg" class="enlarge-link" data-height="1494" data-width="2240"&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-credit"&gt;Bloomberg via Getty&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;  &lt;/figure&gt;         &lt;!-- cache hit 238:single/related:f4fe8bc4a691b84cdd442d0261e6e0db --&gt;&lt;!-- empty --&gt; &lt;p&gt;Bill Gross &lt;a href="https://slate.com/business/2013/10/googles-big-break-how-bill-gross-goto-com-inspired-the-adwords-business-model.html"&gt;made his name&lt;/a&gt; in the tech world &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/1999/09/idealab/"&gt;in the 1990s&lt;/a&gt;, when he came up with a novel way for search engines to make money on advertising. Under his pricing scheme, advertisers would pay when people clicked on their ads. Now, the “pay-per-click” guy has founded a startup called ProRata, which has an audacious, possibly pie-in-the-sky business model: “AI pay-per-use.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Gross, who is CEO of the Pasadena, California, company, doesn’t mince words about the generative AI industry. “It’s stealing,” he says. “They’re shoplifting and laundering the world’s knowledge to their benefit.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;AI companies often argue that they need vast troves of data to create cutting-edge generative tools and that scraping data from the Internet, whether it’s text from websites, video or captions from YouTube, or books pilfered from pirate libraries, is legally allowed. Gross doesn’t buy that argument. “I think it’s bullshit,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So do plenty of media executives, artists, writers, musicians, and other rights-holders who are pushing back—it’s hard to keep up with the constant flurry of &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/matthew-butterick-ai-copyright-lawsuits-openai-meta/"&gt;copyright lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; filed against AI companies, alleging that the way they operate amounts to theft.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Gross thinks ProRata offers a solution that beats legal battles. “To make it fair—that’s what I’m trying to do,” he says. “I don’t think this should be solved by lawsuits.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His company aims to arrange revenue-sharing deals so publishers and individuals get paid when AI companies use their work. Gross explains it like this: “We can take the output of generative AI, whether it's text or an image or music or a movie, and break it down into the components, to figure out where they came from, and then give a percentage attribution to each copyright holder, and then pay them accordingly.” ProRata has filed patent applications for the algorithms it created to assign attribution and make the appropriate payments.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;This week, the company, which has raised $25 million, &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/08/06/news-outlets-ink-deals-with-new-ai-startup-prorataai"&gt;launched&lt;/a&gt; with a number of big-name partners, including Universal Music Group, the Financial Times, The Atlantic, and media company Axel Springer. In addition, it has made deals with authors with large followings, including Tony Robbins, Neal Postman, and Scott Galloway. (It has also partnered with former White House Communications Director Anthony Scaramucci.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Even journalism professor Jeff Jarvis, who believes scraping the web for AI training is fair use, has signed on. He tells WIRED that it’s smart for people in the news industry to band together to get AI companies access to “credible and current information” to include in their output. “I hope that ProRata might open discussion for what could turn into APIs [application programming interfaces] for various content,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following the company’s initial announcement, Gross says he had a deluge of messages from other companies asking to sign up, including a text from Time CEO Jessica Sibley. ProRata secured a deal with Time, the publisher confirmed to WIRED. He plans to pursue agreements with high-profile YouTubers and other individual online stars.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The key word here is “plans.” The company is still in its very early days, and Gross is talking a big game. As a proof of concept, ProRata is launching its own subscription chatbot-style search engine in October. Unlike &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/perplexity-is-a-bullshit-machine/"&gt;other AI search products&lt;/a&gt;, ProRata’s search tool will exclusively use licensed data. There’s nothing scraped using a web crawler. “Nothing from Reddit,” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Ed Newton-Rex, a former Stability AI executive who now runs the &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-executive-ed-newton-rex-turns-crusader-stand-up-for-artists/"&gt;ethical data licensing nonprofit Fairly Trained&lt;/a&gt;, is heartened by ProRata’s debut. “It’s great to see a generative AI company licensing training data before releasing their model, in contrast to many other companies’ approach,” he says. “The deals they have in place further demonstrate media companies’ openness to working with good actors.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;Gross wants the search engine to demonstrate that quality of data is more important than quantity and believes that limiting the model to trustworthy information sources will curb hallucinations. “I’m claiming that 70 million good documents is actually superior to 70 billion bad documents,” he says. “It’s going to lead to better answers.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;What’s more, Gross thinks he can get enough people to sign up for this all-licensed-data AI search engine to make as much money needed to pay its data providers their allotted share. “Every month the partners will get a statement from us saying, ‘Here’s what people search for, here's how your content was used, and here's your &lt;i&gt;pro rata&lt;/i&gt; check,’” he says.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other startups already are jostling for prominence in this new world of training-data licensing, like the marketplaces &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2024/03/05/tollbit-8-million-publisher-ai-marketplace"&gt;TollBit&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://techcrunch.com/2024/06/08/deal-dive-human-native-ai-is-building-the-marketplace-for-ai-training-licensing-deals/"&gt;Human Native AI&lt;/a&gt;. A nonprofit called the &lt;a href="https://www.thedpa.ai/"&gt;Dataset Providers Alliance&lt;/a&gt; was formed earlier this summer to push for more standards in licensing; founding members include services like the &lt;a href="https://www.gcx.co/"&gt;Global Copyright Exchange&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://datarade.ai/"&gt;Datarade&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;ProRata’s business model hinges in part on its plan to license its attribution and payment technologies to other companies, including major AI players. Some of those companies have begun striking their own deals with publishers. (The Atlantic and Axel Springer, for instance, &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/openai-axel-springer-news-licensing-deal-whats-in-it-for-writers/"&gt;have agreements&lt;/a&gt; with OpenAI.) Gross hopes that AI companies will find licensing ProRata’s models more affordable than creating them in-house.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“I’ll license the system to anyone who wants to use it,” Gross says. “I want to make it so cheap that it’s like a Visa or MasterCard fee.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story originally appeared on &lt;a href="https://www.wired.com/story/bill-gross-prorata-generative-ai-business/"&gt;wired.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

Instead, they gained much, much more—some 200 megawatts of programmable capacity to charge or discharge to the grid at will. That’s enough energy to power roughly 40,000 homes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Castellucci, whose pronouns are they/them, acquired this remarkable control after gaining access to the administrative account for GivEnergy, the UK-based energy management provider who supplied the systems. In addition to the control over an estimated 60,000 installed systems, the admin account—which amounts to root control of the company's cloud-connected products—also made it possible for them to enumerate names, email addresses, usernames, phone numbers, and addresses of all other GivEnergy customers (something the researcher didn't actually do).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“My plan is to set up&lt;a href="https://www.home-assistant.io/"&gt; Home Assistant&lt;/a&gt; and integrate it with that, but in the meantime, I decided to let it talk to the cloud,” Castellucci &lt;a href="https://rya.nc/vpp-hack.html"&gt;wrote Thursday&lt;/a&gt;, referring to the recently installed gear. “I set up some scheduled charging, then started experimenting with the API. The next evening, I had control over a&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_power_plant"&gt; virtual power plant&lt;/a&gt; comprised of tens of thousands of grid connected batteries.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Still broken after all these years&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cause of the authentication bypass Castellucci discovered was a programming interface that was protected by an RSA cryptographic key of just 512 bits. The key signs authentication tokens and is the rough equivalent of a master-key. The bit sizes allowed Castellucci to factor the private key underpinning the entire API. The factoring required $70 in cloud computing costs and less than 24 hours. GivEnergy introduced a fix within 24 hours of Castellucci privately disclosing the weakness.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;The first publicly known instance of 512-bit RSA being factored &lt;a href="https://www.iacr.org/archive/eurocrypt2000/1807/18070001-new.pdf"&gt;came in 1999&lt;/a&gt; by an international team of more than a dozen researchers. The feat took a supercomputer and hundreds of other computers seven months to carry out. By 2009 hobbyists spent about three weeks to &lt;a href="https://www.theregister.com/2009/09/23/texas_instruments_calculator_hacking/"&gt;factor 13 512-bit keys&lt;/a&gt; protecting firmware in Texas Instruments calculators from being copied. In 2015, researchers demonstrated &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/10/breaking-512-bit-rsa-with-amazon-ec2-is-a-cinch-so-why-all-the-weak-keys/"&gt;factoring as a service&lt;/a&gt;, a method that used Amazon cloud computing, cost $75, and took about four hours. As processing power has increased, the resources required to factor keys has become ever less. &lt;p&gt;It’s tempting to fault GivEnergy engineers for pinning the security of its infrastructure on a key that’s trivial to break. Castellucci, however, said the responsibility is better assigned to the makers of code libraries developers rely on to implement complex cryptographic processes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Expecting developers to know that 512 bit RSA is insecure clearly doesn’t work,” the security researcher wrote. “They’re not cryptographers. This is not their job. The failure wasn’t that someone used 512 bit RSA. It was that a library they were relying on &lt;em&gt;let them&lt;/em&gt;.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Castellucci noted that OpenSSL, the most widely used cryptographic code library, still offers the option of using 512-bit keys. So does the Go crypto library. Coincidentally, the Python cryptography library removed the option only a few weeks ago (the &lt;a href="https://github.com/pyca/cryptography/commit/83dcbc190165ad5c1f86bddaee76e0b288803c43"&gt;commit&lt;/a&gt; for the change was made in January).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an email, a GivEnergy representative reinforced Castellucci’s assessment, writing:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the problematic encryption approach was picked up via a 3rd party library many years ago, when we were a tiny startup company with only 2, fairly junior software developers &amp;amp; limited experience. Their assumption at the time was that because this encryption was available within the library, it was safe to use. This approach was passed through the intervening years and this part of the codebase was not changed significantly since implementation (so hadn't passed through the review of the more experienced team we now have in place).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-content post-page"&gt;                                           &lt;h2&gt;A key factor&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;RSA encryption relies on extremely large numbers that are the product of two prime numbers. The large number, known as a modulus, is typically denoted as 'n' while the primes are denoted as 'p' and 'q.' While it’s easy to multiply the two prime numbers, it's nearly impossible for someone with only the modulus of a key of sufficient length to identify its two underlying prime numbers, a process known as factorizing. The difficulty of solving this problem allows for the creation of two keys. One is a public key anyone can have and the other is a private key that must be kept absolutely secret. Factorizing a key pair completely breaks their security because it reveals the private portion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difficulty of solving this problem is directly proportional to the number of possible primes that must be tested. The more possibilities the harder it is to find the right pair. This entropy, in turn, is proportional to the bit length of the modulus. In 2019, a team of researchers factored a 795-bit RSA key, making it the biggest key size to be broken at the time. A year later, researchers factorized an &lt;a href="https://listserv.nodak.edu/cgi-bin/wa.exe?A2=NMBRTHRY;dc42ccd1.2002"&gt;829-bit RSA key&lt;/a&gt;. To date, there are no confirmed cases of 1024-bit RSA being factorized, but that doesn't mean it can't be done.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The only barrier for [factorizing 1024-bit RSA] in public is some engineering effort and funding, and finding a large organization willing to put up enough computing power,” &lt;a href="https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~nadiah/"&gt;Nadia Heninger&lt;/a&gt;, a University of California at San Diego professor specializing in cryptography, wrote in an email. “It could have been done years ago if people wanted to—there's no technical barrier, and multiple large companies certainly have the computing resources.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;Anticipating the inevitable fall of 1024-bit RSA, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology stopped allowing its use in 2013 and will stop allowing the use of 2048-bit RSA in 2031. Microsoft earlier this year announced the &lt;a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/whats-new/deprecated-features"&gt;deprecation&lt;/a&gt; of 1024-bit RSA in Windows.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Castillucci’s task was made more difficult because they didn’t have access to the public key securing the admin account. Instead they had only a JWT—short for a JSON Web Token—that was signed by the key. Castellucci explained how they overcame the limitation:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;p&gt;RSA needs three values to work, the modulus &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, the private exponent &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;, and the public exponent &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. An RSA signature is computed as &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt; = &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;d&lt;/sup&gt; mod &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; — message &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; is raised to the power of &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt; modulo &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;. It’s validated by checking that &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; mod &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; ≡ &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt;. With the prime factors of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, it’s trivial to calculate &lt;i&gt;d&lt;/i&gt;, and for a 512 bit key finding the prime factors is doable, but I didn’t have &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt;. By convention, &lt;i&gt;e&lt;/i&gt; is nearly always 65537, but I had no idea what &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; was. I do, however, know algebra.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Subtracting &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; from both sides of the signature verification equation gives &lt;i&gt;s&lt;/i&gt;&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; mod &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; − &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; ≡ 0. Since modular subtraction is associative, that also means that &lt;i&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; − &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; mod &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; ≡ 0. The modulo operation finds the remainder, so &lt;i&gt;s&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/i&gt; − &lt;i&gt;m&lt;/i&gt; is an integer multiple of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;. This is not useful on its own, but it means that with another message and signature, I’d have two different integer multiples of &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;. Running those through a&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greatest_common_divisor"&gt; GCD&lt;/a&gt; algorithm would give me &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; × &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; where &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is a small integer, easily factored out by trial division.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;This Isn’t Textbook RSA&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The math above only covers “&lt;a href="https://crypto.stackexchange.com/a/1449/"&gt;Textbook RSA&lt;/a&gt;” operating on raw numbers, which has a number of problems in practice. It can only operate on numbers smaller than the key’s modulus. The numbers also can’t be too small, otherwise various attacks are possible. To address this, the message is hashed and padded using&lt;a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2437#section-9.2.1"&gt; PKCS #1 v1.5 encoding&lt;/a&gt; before being signed. Not wanting to deal with the encoding, I went looking for a pre-existing tool. After a few false starts, I found&lt;a href="https://github.com/FlorianPicca/JWT-Key-Recovery"&gt; JWT-Key-Recovery&lt;/a&gt;, which quickly provided the modulus.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Cracking the Key&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The modulus is generated by picking large prime numbers, usually denoted &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;q&lt;/i&gt;, and multiplying them together. If you want more detail, please see my previous post,&lt;a href="https://rya.nc/artisanal-rsa.html#a-quick-review-of-rsa-keys"&gt; Artisanal RSA&lt;/a&gt;. The most efficient known algorithm for factoring the modulus back into primes is called&lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_number_field_sieve"&gt; general number field sieve&lt;/a&gt; (GNFS). This wasn’t my first time cracking an RSA key, but it’d been a while, so I found&lt;a href="https://y5c4l3.net/2023/08/19/recovering-rsa-key-pair-with-cado-nfs/#recover-key-pair"&gt; some instructions&lt;/a&gt;. I started cado-nfs on my workstation and let it run overnight. By the time I got done with work the next day, I was feeling impatient and rented a few hundred CPU cores to make it go faster. A few hours and a $70 compute bill later, I had the two prime numbers I needed.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once in possession of the two primes, the researcher used a &lt;a href="https://rya.nc/artisanal-rsa.html#mprsa-py"&gt;custom tool&lt;/a&gt; to generate the private key and then signed the JWT provided with a demo account they were using. With a few additional steps, Castellucci had transformed the token to give the same access admins inside GivEnergy had.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;Based on the sequential numbering of each account, Castellucci estimated that the account had control of about 60,000 installed systems. Assuming each system can charge or discharge 3 to 4 kW per inverter, that equates to roughly 200 MW of electricity.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Castellucci praised GivEnergy for taking their report seriously and fixing it less than a day after receiving it. The researcher confirmed that factorizing the API key was no longer possible. GivEnergy disclosed its previous use of the weak key &lt;a href="https://givenergy.co.uk/real-world-example-givenergy-security-and-cyberthreat-response/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. An analysis of system logs indicated the weakness had never been exploited maliciously, the company said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In an interview, Castellucci returned to the problem of outdated code libraries that still haven’t removed support for weak keys and noted the potentially catastrophic harm that can result years later.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“The GivEnergy issue I found was someone stepping on an old land mine,” they said. “These ones just take a couple years before they actually blow your leg off.”&lt;/p&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

Space Command initially said the event created more than 300 pieces of trackable debris. The military's ground-based radars are capable of tracking objects larger than 10 centimeters (4 inches).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Later Thursday, LeoLabs, a commercial space situational awareness company, &lt;a href="https://x.com/LeoLabs_Space/status/1821674976245670386"&gt;said its radars detected at least 700 objects&lt;/a&gt; attributed to the Chinese rocket. The number of debris fragments could rise to more than 900, LeoLabs said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The culprit is the second stage of China's Long March 6A rocket, which &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/china-deploys-first-satellites-for-a-broadband-network-to-rival-starlink/"&gt;lifted off Tuesday with the first batch of 18 satellites&lt;/a&gt; for a planned Chinese megaconstellation that could eventually number thousands of spacecraft. The Long March 6A's second stage apparently disintegrated after placing its payload of 18 satellites into a polar orbit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Space Command said in a statement it has "observed no immediate threats" and "continues to conduct routine conjunction assessments to support the safety and sustainability of the space domain." According to LeoLabs, radar data indicated the rocket broke apart at an altitude of 503 miles (810 kilometers) at approximately 4:10 pm EDT (20:10 UTC) on Tuesday, around 13-and-a-half hours after it lifted off from northern China.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this altitude, it will take decades or centuries for the wispy effect of aerodynamic drag to pull the debris back into the atmosphere. As the objects drift lower, their orbits will cross paths with SpaceX's Starlink Internet satellites, the International Space Station and other crew spacecraft, and thousands more pieces of orbital debris, putting commercial and government satellites at risk of collision.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;A new debris field of nearly 1,000 objects would be a significant addition to the approximately 46,000 objects Space Command tracks in Earth orbit. According to &lt;a href="https://planet4589.org/space/debris/debriscat/debris.html"&gt;statistics compiled by Jonathan McDowell&lt;/a&gt;, an astrophysicist who monitors global launch and spaceflight activity, this would rank in the top five of all debris-generation events since the dawn of the Space Age.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;This rocket has a track record&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The medium-class Long March 6A rocket has launched seven times since debuting in March 2022, and military and commercial satellite tracking organizations have reported several breakups of the rocket's upper stage. In November 2022, a Long March 6A upper stage disintegrated in orbit, creating a debris field of more than 500 trackable objects, &lt;a href="https://orbitaldebris.jsc.nasa.gov/quarterly-news/pdfs/odqnv27i1.pdf"&gt;according to NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Commercial satellite tracking companies observed smaller debris fields following several other Long March 6A flights this year.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In its space environment statistics report, the European Space Agency says there have been more than 640 "breakups, explosions, collisions, or anomalous events resulting in fragmentation" in orbit. So these things happen frequently. But it's not clear what makes the Long March 6A, which has a relatively short flight history, particularly vulnerable to creating debris.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="image shortcode-img center large" style="width:100%"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165527973.jpg" class="enlarge" data-height="1200" data-width="1800" alt="A Long March 6A rocket launches the first 18 Internet satellites for China's Qianfan, or Thousand Sails, broadband network."&gt;&lt;img alt="A Long March 6A rocket launches the first 18 Internet satellites for China's Qianfan, or Thousand Sails, broadband network." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165527973-640x427.jpg" width="640" height="427" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165527973-1280x853.jpg 2x"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/GettyImages-2165527973.jpg" class="enlarge-link" data-height="1200" data-width="1800"&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="sep"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; A Long March 6A rocket launches the first 18 Internet satellites for China's Qianfan, or Thousand Sails, broadband network.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-credit"&gt;&lt;a rel="nofollow" class="caption-link" href="https://www.gettyimages.com/detail/news-photo/long-march-6a-rocket-carrying-the-satellite-group-blasts-news-photo/2165527973?adppopup=true"&gt;VCG via Getty Images&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most rockets operating today either reignite their engines to reenter the atmosphere after deploying their payloads, or if that's not feasible, they "passivate" themselves to empty their propellant tanks and drain their batteries to reduce the risk of an explosion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In a report last year, NASA's Orbital Debris Program Office said the Long March 6A upper stage has a mass of about 5,800 kilograms (12,800 pounds) without kerosene and liquid oxygen propellants. It is powered by a single YF-115 engine.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;The launch Tuesday began the deployment of China's "Thousand Sails" Internet network, which will initially consist of 1,296 satellites, with the possibility to expand to more than 14,000 spacecraft. This will require numerous launches, some of which will presumably use the Long March 6A.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“If even a fraction of the launches needed to field this Chinese megaconstellation generate as much debris as this first launch, the result would be a notable addition to the space debris population in LEO (low-Earth orbit),” said Audrey Schaffer, vice president of strategy and policy at Slingshot Aerospace, a commercial satellite tracking and analytics firm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China has been responsible for several space debris incidents beyond the latest problems with the Long March 6A rocket. In 2007, China destroyed one of its own spacecraft in an anti-satellite missile test. This was the worst-ever instance of creating space debris, resulting in more than 3,000 trackable objects, and an estimate 150,000 or more smaller fragments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On four occasions from 2020 through 2022, the massive core stage of China's heavy-lift Long March 5B rocket has &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2022/10/china-launches-its-third-space-station-module-but-rocket-will-return-controllably/"&gt;reentered the atmosphere in an uncontrolled manner&lt;/a&gt;, raising concerns that falling debris could put people and property at risk on Earth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;China plans more flights with its Long March 5B and Long March 6A rockets. China continued flying the Long March 5B rocket despite the risk it posed to people on the ground. Debris fields in orbit, however, don't directly threaten any people on Earth, but they do raise the risk to satellites of all nations, including China's own spacecraft.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Events like this highlight the importance of adherence to existing space debris mitigation guidelines to reduce the creation of new space debris and underscore the need for robust space domain awareness capabilities to rapidly detect, track, and catalog newly-launched space objects so they can be screened for potential conjunctions," Schaffer said in a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This story was updated with the detection of additional debris fragments by LeoLabs.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

My gripe is that it is entirely your own fault when you get hit by enemies.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On a &lt;a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1"&gt;PC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/doom-doom-ii/9p46m5jq2ptf"&gt;Xbox&lt;/a&gt; X or S, or &lt;a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-PPSA21444_00-OSIRIS2000000000"&gt;PlayStation&lt;/a&gt; 5, you can play &lt;em&gt;Doom &lt;/em&gt;at 120 fps at 4K. You are moving so ridiculously fast, speed-skating across those Marine bases and/or hellscapes, that the imps tossing fireballs at you feel like they're a parent gently coaxing their kid to catch a softball. Even the enemies with instant-hitting guns feel like they're winding up a tree sap cannon. The one time I died inside the first three levels of classic &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; was when I jet-walked right off a circular path and into an inescapable poison moat.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="image shortcode-img full full-width" style="width:1920px"&gt;&lt;img alt="Does a flame thrower work against creatures that literally live in Hell? Only one way to find out." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/doom_redo1.jpg" width="1920" height="1080"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;Does a flame thrower work against creatures that literally live in Hell? Only one way to find out.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-credit"&gt;Bethesda Game Studios&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's easy to recommend this newly packed-up and enhanced edition of these two first-person icons, released Thursday as part of QuakeCon. For one thing, it's being offered by Nightdive Studios, which has been turning out fan-favorite (and generally Ars-approved) remasters of games like &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/dark-forces-remaster-is-yet-another-all-timer-fps-coming-back-around/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dark Forces&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/interview-how-system-shock-balanced-faithful-recreation-and-modern-design/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;System Shock&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/quake-remaster-owners-should-go-download-its-free-next-gen-upgrade/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quake&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/quake-ii-gets-a-remaster-for-pc-and-consoles-and-its-exactly-what-it-needs-to-be/"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Quake II&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. For another, it's a real bundle, with both games, a huge number of classic add-on maps (including &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/john-romero-will-release-18-new-maps-for-dooms-25th-anniversary/"&gt;John Romero's &lt;em&gt;Sigil&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and an entirely new episode, &lt;em&gt;Legacy of Rust&lt;/em&gt;, made by folks from Nightdive, id Software, and &lt;em&gt;Wolfenstein&lt;/em&gt; auteurs MachineGames.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And then there's how playing these levels feels, which to me is as close as I can get to the caffeine-pulsing, speed-metal-blasting flow state I remember from much younger days. I've installed &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; and played a few levels now and then, but this is the first time I've made plans to keep going after the first session. After sprinting through a well-trod Hell, I'll be eager to keep going in &lt;em&gt;Legacy of Rust&lt;/em&gt;, where I saw quite a few cool design tricks in just a couple levels. Further along, new weapons await me, and I am eager to pick them up.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;figure class="video"&gt;&lt;div class="wrapper" style="padding-bottom: 56.122448979592%;"&gt;&lt;iframe style="display:block" type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-4-xswoPRpo?start=0&amp;amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Doom + Doom II&lt;/em&gt; release trailer.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Wonderful, optional options&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;It helps that this version incorporates the rearranged, real-instruments "IDKFA" soundtrack from &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hulshult"&gt;Andrew Hulshult&lt;/a&gt;, first &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGK1dr-Ql0w"&gt;made available in 2016&lt;/a&gt; and now officially putting some heavy crunch into the classic tunes, along with some new &lt;em&gt;Doom II&lt;/em&gt; tracks. It deserves its place in this official package, because it rips. As with almost everything else, the upgrade is optional—you can stick with MIDI if you like.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are lots of accessibility options now—high-contrast text, text-to-speech in chat, and more—along with quality-of-life stuff. I was wary of having the crosshairs light up when an enemy (or barrel) would be hit, but given the sometimes unfair 2.5-D nature of the level design, and the spread of some of the bullet weapons, I'm keeping it on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="image shortcode-img full full-width" style="width:1920px"&gt;&lt;img alt="Cacodemons, chain guns, high-school-notebook Satanism—but in 4K, at 120Hz, and incredibly loud, if you like." src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/doom_redo3.jpg" width="1920" height="1080"&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;Cacodemons, chain guns, high-school-notebook Satanism—but in 4K, at 120Hz, and incredibly loud, if you like.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-credit"&gt;Bethesda Game Studios&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;If all that wasn't enough for you, there's 16-player co-op and deathmatch, with cross-platform play across Steam, Windows, Epic, and GOG on PC, and on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch consoles, using room codes to connect everybody (and, it must be noted, a Bethesda account). There's even split-screen multiplayer, with up to eight people on a (very big) PC screen. Nightdive's port of the code to its KEX engine should make it easier for mods to be brought forward to this edition.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;A caveat here that while the author is broadly aware of the many, many upgrades, mods, and other good things made possible by the open-source code and ports of &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; games (including &lt;a href="https://zdoom.org/index"&gt;ZDoom&lt;/a&gt;), he can't say exactly how they compare to this bundle. While Bethesda and Nightdive seem to have created a space for uploading mods and levels, and keeping the basic DOS version available, it remains to be seen how they work out over the long run. If open-source &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; was always good enough for you, or you don't like the idea of rebundling stuff that started out in the open, by all means, save yourself the $10 here. For many, though, this is just a far easier way to get at all the good stuff now possible in demon-shooting land.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you haven't checked out &lt;em&gt;Doom&lt;/em&gt; in a while, whether sitting in your library or just $10 away now, this is too easy an excuse to check in on it again. Do it soon. Hell devours the indolent, you know.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This post was updated at 8:40 a.m. to note the potential tension of Bethesda's rebundling of Doom against its open-source community.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

There has been a lot of drama over the last week involving NASA, the crew of Starliner on board the International Space Station, and the launch of the Crew-9 mission on a Falcon 9 rocket. NASA is now down to a binary choice: Fly Butch Wilmore and Suni Williams home on Starliner, or send two astronauts to orbit on Crew-9, and return Wilmore and Williams next February on that spacecraft. We should know NASA's final decision next week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As always, we &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.wufoo.com/forms/launch-stories/"&gt;welcome reader submissions&lt;/a&gt;, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site). Each report will include information on small-, medium-, and heavy-lift rockets as well as a quick look ahead at the next three launches on the calendar.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="image shortcode-img center full" style="width:560px"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/smalll.png" width="560" height="81"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Firefly inks another big Alpha contract&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://fireflyspace.com/news/firefly-aerospace-announces-second-multi-launch-agreement-with-l3harris-for-up-to-20-alpha-launches/"&gt;Firefly Aerospace said Wednesday&lt;/a&gt; that it has signed a multi-launch agreement with L3Harris Technologies for up to 20 launches on Firefly’s Alpha rocket, including two to four missions per year from 2027 to 2031, depending on customer needs. The new agreement is in addition to Firefly’s existing multi-launch agreement with L3Harris for three Alpha missions in 2026. What is not clear is exactly what satellites L3Harris wants to launch.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Putting skins on the wall&lt;/em&gt; ... "Firefly continues to see growing demand for Alpha’s responsive small-lift services, and we’re committed to providing a dedicated launch option that takes our customers directly to their preferred orbits," said Peter Schumacher, Interim CEO at Firefly Aerospace. This represents another significant win for the Alpha rocket, which can lift about 1 metric ton to low-Earth orbit. Under terms of a separate agreement announced in June, Lockheed purchased 15 launches from Firefly, with an option for 10 more, through the year 2029. (submitted by Ken the Bin and EllPeaTea)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Electron pushing launch cadence&lt;/strong&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240807163035/en/Rocket-Lab-Schedules-Next-Electron-Launch-Just-Eight-Days-After-Previous-Mission/"&gt;Rocket Lab announced&lt;/a&gt; Wednesday that it has scheduled the launch for its 52nd Electron mission, which will deploy a single satellite for American space tech company Capella Space. The mission is scheduled to launch during a 14-day window that opens on August 11 from Rocket Lab Launch Complex 1 on New Zealand’s Mahia Peninsula.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Getting to ten much faster&lt;/em&gt; ... Should this launch take place at the opening of this window, this Electron flight would occur just eight days after the most recent Electron mission on August 3. This upcoming mission for Capella will be Rocket Lab’s tenth mission for 2024, equaling the company’s annual launch record set in 2023.

PLD Space plans to start building launch facilities for its Miura 5 rocket in October from the Diamant site at Guiana Space Centre, cofounder and Chief Business Development Officer Raúl Verdú said this week, &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/pld-space-to-start-building-french-guiana-launch-facilities-next-month/"&gt;Space News reports&lt;/a&gt;. Diamant has been dormant for decades after once being used for the French rocket of the same name, and “in the area where we are there is nothing,” Verdú said, “we have to do everything from scratch.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lots of things to build&lt;/em&gt; ... PLD Space, Germany’s Isar Aerospace and a handful of other small European launchers are working with France’s CNES space agency to convert the site into a multi-use facility. In June, the Spanish company announced a 10 million euro ($11 million) investment plan for 15,765 square meters of space at Diamant, divided between a launch zone and a preparation area comprising an integration hangar, clean room, control center, commercial and work offices. CNES is providing common infrastructure such as roads and electricity networks.

Interstellar Technologies announced a new fundraising round that brings its total capital and government funding to $117 million, &lt;a href="https://payloadspace.com/japanese-rocket-maker-nets-3-1b-yen-21m-series-e/?oly_enc_id=9796C0398467A4S"&gt;Payload reports&lt;/a&gt;. After building and launching a suborbital rocket called Momo, the company is building its first orbital rocket, dubbed ZERO, with a goal of flying in 2025. This rocket is intended to carry 800 kg of payload to low-Earth orbit, and be cheaper than Rocket Lab’s Electron, COO Keiji Atsuta said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Big help from Japan&lt;/em&gt; ... Interstellar’s latest round was led by Japanese VC fund SBI and NTT Docomo, the country’s leading mobile firm. Previously, it received a large amount of funding, $96 million, from the Japanese government. “The Japanese government has explicitly expressed its support for private rockets due to the growing importance of the space industry, and being selected for this support program has significantly accelerated our business,” Interstellar CEO Takahiro Inagawa said.

The Canadian government says it has completed negotiations with the United States on an agreement that would allow the use of US space launch technology, expertise, and data for space launches in Canada, &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/canada-space-tech-us-launch-agreement-0a0ef22f771f5d6672681d606408d39d#:~:text=OTTAWA%2C%20Ontario%20(AP)%20%E2%80%94,for%20space%20launches%20in%20Canada."&gt;the AP reports&lt;/a&gt;. Maritime Launch Services, the company developing Canada’s first commercial spaceport in northeastern Nova Scotia, called the agreement a major step forward for the industry.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;US rockets could launch from Canada&lt;/em&gt; ... Ottawa has said it hopes to position Canada as future leader in commercial space launches. The country has geographical advantages, including a vast, sparsely populated territory and high-inclination orbits. The agreement, which is yet to be signed, will establish the legal and technical safeguards needed while ensuring the proper handling of sensitive technology, the government said in a news release.

NASA has been studying various contingencies, but officials appear to have settled on two different options for bringing the two astronauts back to Earth. They could still fly back on Starliner if NASA engineers become more comfortable with the uncertainty about the thruster performance, and if so, they would do so during the second half of this month or the first part of September. Alternatively, NASA could launch the Crew-9 mission with a complement of two rather than four astronauts, and Wilmore and Williams would join that "increment" on the space station and fly back to Earth in February 2025.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rocket Lab test-fires Archimedes engine&lt;/strong&gt;. The launch firm has successfully hot-fired its new rocket engine Archimedes for the first time, &lt;a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240808926407/en/Rocket-Lab-Completes-Successful-First-Hot-Fire-of-Archimedes-Engine-for-Neutron-Rocket"&gt;it said Thursday&lt;/a&gt;. Rocket Lab’s engineers completed the hot fire test at the company’s Engine Test Complex within NASA’s Stennis Space Center in Hancock County, Mississippi. According to Rocket Lab, the Archimedes performed well and ticked off several key test objectives, including reaching 102 percent power.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Fast rocket, faster development&lt;/em&gt; ... This gives the company confidence in the design of the engine, which will power the medium-lift Neutron rocket. "Taking a new staged combustion liquid rocket engine from cleansheet design to hot fire in just a couple of years is industry-leading stuff," Rocket Lab chief executive Peter Beck said in the news release. The company is working toward the debut launch of Neutron in mid-2025, but a launch any time next year would be impressive.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;China begins launching megaconstellation&lt;/strong&gt;. A Long March 6A rocket delivered 18 Qianfan satellites into polar orbit following liftoff Tuesday from the Taiyuan launch base in northern China's Shanxi province. Qianfan translates to "Thousand Sails," and the 18 satellites launched Tuesday are the first of potentially thousands of spacecraft planned by Shanghai Spacecom Satellite Technology (SSST), a company backed by Shanghai's municipal government, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/china-deploys-first-satellites-for-a-broadband-network-to-rival-starlink/"&gt;Ars reports&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, an issue with the rocket's upper stage &lt;a href="https://spacenews.com/chinese-megaconstellation-launch-creates-field-of-space-debris/"&gt;created many pieces of debris&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;A potential Starlink competitor&lt;/em&gt; ... Chinese officials have long signaled their interest in deploying a satellite network, or maybe several, to beam broadband Internet signals across China and other nations within its sphere of influence. Two serious efforts are underway in China to develop a rival to SpaceX's Starlink network, which the Chinese government has banned in its territory. One of these is Qianfan, and Shanghai officials only began releasing details of this constellation last year. A filing with the International Telecommunication Union suggests the developers of Shanghai-based megaconstellation initially plan to deploy 1,296 satellites at an altitude of about 1,160 kilometers (721 miles). (submitted by EllPeaTea and Ken the Bin)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Polaris Dawn launch date reset to late August&lt;/strong&gt;. SpaceX is now targeting August 26 for the launch of Polaris Dawn, a crewed flight to Earth orbit that will feature the first-ever private spacewalk, &lt;a href="https://www.space.com/spacex-polaris-dawn-astronaut-mission-launch-august-26"&gt;Space.com reports&lt;/a&gt;. Those four crewmembers are billionaire entrepreneur Jared Isaacman, who will command the mission; pilot Scott "Kidd" Poteet, a retired US Air Force lieutenant colonel; and mission specialists Sarah Gillis and Anna Menon, both of whom are SpaceX engineers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Going for record heights&lt;/em&gt; ... Polaris Dawn will take the quartet to Earth orbit on a free-flying mission that does not link up with the International Space Station. The planned private spacewalk is not the only way this mission will make history: Polaris Dawn will orbit our planet at an altitude of about 870 miles (1,400 kilometers), taking the crew farther from Earth than any mission since the Apollo era.

The NASA program to develop a new upper stage for the Space Launch System rocket is seven years behind schedule and significantly over budget, a new report from the space agency's inspector general finds. However, beyond these headline numbers, there is also some eye-opening information about the project's prime contractor, Boeing, and its poor quality control practices, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/space/2024/08/a-new-report-finds-boeings-rockets-are-built-with-an-unqualified-work-force/"&gt;Ars reports&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lack of a trained &lt;/em&gt;&lt;span style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"&gt;&lt;em&gt;workforce&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;... At the Michoud Assembly Facility in southern Louisiana, where the Exploration Upper Stage is being manufactured, federal observers have issued a striking number of "Corrective Action Requests" to Boeing. "According to Safety and Mission Assurance officials at NASA and DCMA officials at Michoud, Boeing’s quality control issues are largely caused by its workforce having insufficient aerospace production experience," the report states. "The lack of a trained and qualified workforce increases the risk that the contractor will continue to manufacture parts and components that do not adhere to NASA requirements and industry standards."

On Thursday, Blue Origin used the test module of the first stage of its New Glenn rocket to simulate recovery operations at Port Canaveral, Florida. "The operation validated our tooling and procedures for recovering our first stage from the landing vessel, bringing us another step closer to our first launch," &lt;a href="https://x.com/blueorigin/status/1821638974793789575"&gt;the company said&lt;/a&gt; on the social media site X. The 200-foot-tall simulator was quite the striking object to see towering over the port.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Recovery rehearsal soon&lt;/em&gt; ... In an additional post, the chief executive of Blue Origin, Dave Limp, added, "The mobile harbor crane, remotely operated lift tool or 'ROLT,' and the breakover fixture work in tandem to lift and reorient the booster from vertical to horizontal so we can transport it back for refurbishment and re-flight. Coming soon: a full recovery rehearsal with our landing vessel." It's exciting to see Blue coming out with more and more information about the large rocket before its debut within the next few months.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Next three launches&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 9&lt;/strong&gt;: Falcon 9 | Starlink 8-3 | Cape Canaveral Space Force Station, Florida | 12:13 UTC&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 10&lt;/strong&gt;: Falcon 9 | Starlink 10-7 | Kennedy Space Center, Florida | 11:21 UTC&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;August 11&lt;/strong&gt;: Electron | "A Sky Full of SARs" | Mahia Peninsula, New Zealand | 11:15 UTC&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="image shortcode-img center full" style="width:120px"&gt;&lt;img src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rocket.png" width="120" height="120"&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The 2024 Honda Prologue—a dependable but somewhat dull EV</title>

Designed around General Motors' new platform of Ultium batteries and motors, it was planned to be the first in a series of EVs to benefit from this platform-sharing with GM. But &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/10/honda-cancels-plan-for-cheap-electric-vehicles-ending-collaboration-with-gm/"&gt;late last year, that plan was shelved&lt;/a&gt;. Instead, Honda will focus on a &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/01/these-are-hondas-concepts-for-its-new-family-of-evs-due-in-2026/"&gt;homegrown family of EVs&lt;/a&gt;, investing $11 billion on &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/04/honda-to-spend-11-billion-on-four-ev-factories-in-north-america/"&gt;North American production&lt;/a&gt; alone. That makes the Prologue rather accurately named, but it's also something of a dead end, as it's built on an underlying architecture that won't be seen again wearing the Honda wings.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Prologue is a midsize SUV, so it's larger than &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/05/clever-hybrid-tech-impresses-with-40-mpg-2023-honda-cr-v-sport/"&gt;a CR-V&lt;/a&gt;. It's identical in size to &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2023/12/the-2024-chevrolet-blazer-first-drive-gms-ev-platform-goes-mainstream/"&gt;the Chevrolet Blazer&lt;/a&gt;, and the twin-motor all-wheel drive powertrain in our test Prologue Elite generates the same 288 hp (214 kW) and 333 lb-ft (451 Nm), fed by the same 85 kWh capacity Ultium battery pack.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;That shouldn't be too surprising—the Prologue comes from the same GM factory in Ramos Arizpe, Mexico, as the Blazer EV. But Honda was responsible for signing off on the ride and handling and, as with &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/cars/2024/05/the-2024-acura-zdx-type-s-this-electric-suv-feels-polished-but-heavy/"&gt;the more upmarket Acura ZDX&lt;/a&gt;, also took charge of the car's UI/UX. And the result is an EV that does not feel like a Blazer EV to drive, nor to sit in, mostly.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;At 5,273 lbs (2,392 kg), the Prologue is not a light car, but it still manages to weigh less than either the AWD Blazer EV or the (remarkably heavy) Acura ZDX. There's no option for air springs on the Prologue, even on the top-trim Elite, but the conventional springs and dampers in the multilink suspension did a notably better job of filtering out harshness from the road than the Blazer EVs I drove last December.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide"&gt;     &lt;ul&gt;               &lt;li data-thumb="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-2-150x150.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-2-scaled.jpg" data-responsive="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-2-980x735.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-2-1440x1080.jpg 2560" data-sub-html="#caption-2041674"&gt;           &lt;figure style="height:735px;"&gt;             &lt;img style="display:block;" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-2-980x735.jpg" /&gt;                           &lt;figcaption id="caption-2041674"&gt;                 &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;                                   &lt;div class="caption"&gt;                     The Prologue is 192 inches (4,877 mm) long, 78.3 inches (1,989 mm) wide, and 65.2 inches (1,656 mm) tall.                  &lt;/div&gt;                                                   &lt;div class="credit"&gt;                     &lt;span class="icon icon-camera"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;                                           Jonathan Gitlin                                      &lt;/div&gt;                               &lt;/figcaption&gt;                       &lt;/figure&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;               &lt;li data-thumb="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-3-150x150.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-3-scaled.jpg" data-responsive="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-3-980x735.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-3-1440x1080.jpg 2560" data-sub-html="#caption-2041675"&gt;           &lt;figure style="height:735px;"&gt;             &lt;img style="display:block;" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-3-980x735.jpg" /&gt;                           &lt;figcaption id="caption-2041675"&gt;                 &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;                                   &lt;div class="caption"&gt;                     It's the best-looking Ultium-based car I've seen so far.

You'll want to make sure there's a good gap in traffic before pulling out from a side street to make a left turn, given its rate of acceleration. And as you approach full throttle, the front wheels start to torque-steer thanks to tires that prioritize low rolling resistance over lateral grip.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;On the other hand, I found the Prologue a pleasant car to drive slowly, despite it being on the larger side of things. The steering was smooth and responsive, and in its strongest setting, the one-pedal driving mode was very well-calibrated for the 20–30 mph (32–48 km/h) speed zone that covers most city driving these days.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Prologue's infotainment made it near-impossible to get a good idea of long-term range efficiency, resetting its display with each journey. In the height of &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/weather/2024/07/15/dc-heat-wave-hottest-summer-record/"&gt;the hottest summer on record here in DC&lt;/a&gt;, at least 20 percent of each trip's energy use was devoted to running the air conditioning, and between that and the 21-inch wheels and all-wheel drive powertrain of the Elite trim, the best I saw displayed was 3 miles/kWh (20.7 kWh/100 km).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Elite has the shortest EPA range of all the Prologue trims at 273 miles (439 km). But all of them can fast-charge at the same speed, taking 35 minutes to get from 20 to 80 percent. During charging, the Prologue maintained a relatively high rate across the entire 35 minutes rather than tapering off rapidly, as is common with earlier EVs.&lt;/p&gt;   &lt;div class="gallery shortcode-gallery gallery-wide"&gt;     &lt;ul&gt;               &lt;li data-thumb="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-8-150x150.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-8-scaled.jpg" data-responsive="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-8-980x735.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-8-1440x1080.jpg 2560" data-sub-html="#caption-2041683"&gt;           &lt;figure style="height:735px;"&gt;             &lt;img style="display:block;" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-8-980x735.jpg" /&gt;                           &lt;figcaption id="caption-2041683"&gt;                 &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;                                   &lt;div class="caption"&gt;                     A DC fast charge should only take 35 minutes to hit 80 percent.                   &lt;/div&gt;                                                   &lt;div class="credit"&gt;                     &lt;span class="icon icon-camera"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;                                           Jonathan Gitlin                                      &lt;/div&gt;                               &lt;/figcaption&gt;                       &lt;/figure&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;               &lt;li data-thumb="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-9-150x150.jpg" data-src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-9-scaled.jpg" data-responsive="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-9-980x735.jpg 1080, https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-9-1440x1080.jpg 2560" data-sub-html="#caption-2041684"&gt;           &lt;figure style="height:735px;"&gt;             &lt;img style="display:block;" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-9-980x735.jpg" /&gt;                           &lt;figcaption id="caption-2041684"&gt;                 &lt;span class="icon caption-arrow icon-drop-indicator"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;                                   &lt;div class="caption"&gt;                     EA chargers now tell you how much power the car is requesting as well as how much power the charger is feeding it.                   &lt;/div&gt;                                                   &lt;div class="credit"&gt;                     &lt;span class="icon icon-camera"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;                                           Jonathan Gitlin                                      &lt;/div&gt;                               &lt;/figcaption&gt;                       &lt;/figure&gt;         &lt;/li&gt;           &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;                                                   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div itemprop="articleBody" class="article-content post-page"&gt;                                           &lt;h2&gt;The pitfalls of platform sharing&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Enabling one-pedal driving highlighted a pitfall of using someone else's platform to build your car, in that you can be stuck with questionable design decisions baked in. In this case, GM's Ultium platform has relegated the headlight and one-pedal driving settings to the infotainment touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of using the drive select stalk behind the wheel to toggle between D and B as you might in the Bolt or a switch on the center console as found in most Hondas, your target in the Prologue is the little foot icon that is always found near the top-left corner of the touchscreen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I'm less annoyed by the decision to move the headlight controls there, as these can be set to automatic and then left to their own devices. But I often want to switch one-pedal driving on or off during a journey, depending upon my route, and aiming for a small target on a touchscreen to do that is far from ideal. Here's hoping that Honda's engineers decide to do things better with the in-house EV platform they are currently developing, due in 2026.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fact, there's still some regenerative braking, and therefore drag, even with one-pedal driving set completely to "off," so the Prologue will not coast along a level stretch of highway as effortlessly as some other EVs.&lt;/p&gt;

The CarPlay integration includes showing you turn-by-turn directions from Apple Maps in the heads-up display and Apple Maps as an alternative to Google Maps on the main instrument display in front of the driver.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;There are reasons to stick with the built-in version of Google Maps—if you select a fast charger as your destination in the native navigation app, it preconditions the battery pack for better DC fast charging. As convenient as a phone-casting interface is, that deep of a hook into the car's powertrain is unlikely to ever be something an automaker is OK with enabling from a third-party device.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Brake!!!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;One thing that definitely lets you know you're in a Honda is the car's forward collision warning. For reasons that have never really been explained, the brand has always had perhaps the jumpiest collision warning system—you can expect at least a couple of false positive warnings even on a short drive. The Acura ZDX did that, too, but GM's Ultium EVs don't, so it's an interesting example of what does and doesn't make the cut when porting your brand over to another company's platform.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All trim levels of the Prologue get a standard suite of advanced driver assists on top of collision warning, including automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alerts. There's also adaptive cruise control and lane keeping as standard, but there's no option for Super Cruise, even on the Elite trim.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="image shortcode-img center large" style="width:100%"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-20-scaled.jpg" class="enlarge" data-height="1920" data-width="2560" alt="What lessons will Honda learn from this platform-sharing exercise, I wonder?"&gt;&lt;img alt="What lessons will Honda learn from this platform-sharing exercise, I wonder?" src="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-20-640x480.jpg" width="640" height="480" srcset="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-20-1280x960.jpg 2x"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;figcaption class="caption"&gt;&lt;div class="caption-text"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/2024-Honda-Prologue-20-scaled.jpg" class="enlarge-link" data-height="1920" data-width="2560"&gt;Enlarge&lt;/a&gt; &lt;span class="sep"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt; What lessons will Honda learn from this platform-sharing exercise, I wonder?&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-credit"&gt;Jonathan Gitlin&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;&lt;/figure&gt; &lt;p&gt;At $57,900 plus a delivery charge (but before the $7,500 clean vehicle tax credit), the Elite is not exactly cheap, and if my research is correct, it's about $4,000 more expensive than the all-wheel drive Blazer EV, which is a pretty premium to pay for CarPlay. But you also get much more restrained exterior and interior styling with the Honda, which at no point reminded me of a gaming PC.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The cheaper trims represent better value—with the tax credit, the single-motor Prologue EX should cost less than $42,000, and it will go 24 miles (39 km) longer on a single charge, too. For that, you'll get a dependable family SUV, but it won't be the most exciting EV you put on your driveway.&lt;/p&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

In all, 71 types of products made between May 10, 2024, and July 29, 2024, and sold nationwide have been recalled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to &lt;a href="https://www.cdc.gov/listeria/outbreaks/delimeats-7-24/index.html"&gt;an update Thursday from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/a&gt;, the outbreak has now sickened a total of 43 people, an increase from 34 last week. There have been 43 hospitalizations, up from 33 last week. The illnesses are reported from 13 states. The three deaths in the outbreak include one from Illinois and one from New Jersey, and the newly reported death is from Virginia. The CDC expects the tally of illnesses so far to be a significant undercount of actual cases, and additional states may be affected.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The illnesses in the outbreak are caused by &lt;em&gt;Listeria monocytogenes&lt;/em&gt;, a foodborne bacterium that is particularly dangerous to people who are pregnant, people age 65 years or older, and people who have weakened immune systems. In these high-risk groups, the bacteria are more likely to move beyond the gastrointestinal system to cause an invasive infection called listeriosis. During pregnancy, listeriosis can cause miscarriage, stillbirth, premature delivery, or a life-threatening infection in newborns. For non-pregnant people who develop listeriosis, nearly 90 percent require hospitalization, and 1 in 6 die.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;Symptoms of listeriosis can include fever, muscle aches, headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, and convulsions that are sometimes preceded by diarrhea or other gastrointestinal symptoms.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Growing outbreak&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many more people may be sickened in the outbreak than the current numbers indicate. For many infected people, the bacteria only cause relatively mild infections that don't require medical care. Even if they do seek medical care, laboratories don't routinely test for listeriosis in patients with mild gastrointestinal illnesses. Lastly, while many infected people develop symptoms within two weeks of an exposure, symptoms can develop up to 10 weeks after eating a contaminated food, and there are additional lag times in connecting cases to an outbreak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to an investigation by the CDC, the first cases detected in the outbreak date back to the end of June. Health investigators in Maryland and New York independently identified &lt;em&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/em&gt; in unopened containers of Boar's Head brand liverwurst. Further testing confirmed at the end of July that the strain of &lt;em&gt;L. monocytogenes&lt;/em&gt; found in the liverwurst products matched the strain making people sick in the outbreak.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The CDC advises people not to eat any of the recalled products. Instead, discard them or return them for a refund. Boar's Head has &lt;a href="https://boarshead.com/pages/2024-07-30-july-2024-product-recall"&gt;a list of the recalled products&lt;/a&gt; on its website. The CDC advises consumers to look for "EST. 12612 or "P-12612" inside the USDA mark of inspection on the product labels. People who purchased recalled products should clean their fridges, &lt;a href="https://www.fsis.usda.gov/recalls-alerts/boars-head-provisions-co--expands-recall-ready-eat-meat-and-poultry-products-due"&gt;according to the US Department of Agriculture&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

The heat sensor improves the camera's ability to spot and remove people from videos.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="caption-credit"&gt;Brenda Ahearn, Michigan Engineering&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/figcaption&gt;  &lt;/figure&gt;         &lt;!-- cache miss 239:single/related:0645c820df73d940b62d9dd4d322254c --&gt;&lt;!-- empty --&gt; &lt;p&gt;Roombas can be both convenient and fun, &lt;a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2024/05/cats-playing-with-robots-proves-a-winning-combo-in-novel-art-installation/"&gt;particularly for cats&lt;/a&gt; who like to ride on top of the machines as they make their cleaning rounds. But the obstacle-avoidance cameras collect images of the environment—sometimes rather personal images, as was the case in 2020 when images of a young woman on the toilet captured by a Romba &lt;a href="https://www.technologyreview.com/2022/12/19/1065306/roomba-irobot-robot-vacuums-artificial-intelligence-training-data-privacy/"&gt;leaked to social media&lt;/a&gt; after being uploaded to a cloud server. It's a vexing problem in this very online digital age, in which Internet-connected cameras are used in a variety of home monitoring and health applications, as well as more public-facing applications like autonomous vehicles and security cameras.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;University of Michigan (UM) engineers have been developing a possible solution: PrivacyLens, a new camera that can detect people in images based on body temperature and replace their likeness with a generic stick figure. They have filed a provisional patent for the device, described in a &lt;a href="https://petsymposium.org/popets/2024/popets-2024-0146.php"&gt;recent paper&lt;/a&gt; published in the Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium, &lt;a href="https://petsymposium.org/2024/program.php"&gt;held last month&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Most consumers do not think about what happens to the data collected by their favorite smart home devices. In most cases, raw audio, images and videos are being streamed off these devices to the manufacturers' cloud-based servers, regardless of whether or not the data is actually needed for the end application," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1051407"&gt;said co-author Alanson Sample&lt;/a&gt;. "A smart device that removes personally identifiable information (PII) before sensitive data is sent to private servers will be a far safer product than what we currently have."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The authors identified three distinct kinds of security threats associated with such devices. The Roomba incident is an example of data over-collection, outside of what the user may have knowingly agreed to be collected, along with authorized access with unauthorized sharing. (Gig workers in Venezuela tasked with labeling the data to train AI posted the revealing images to online forums.) An outside hacker constitutes unauthorized access.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Smart doorbells, for instance, have "encrypted" camera feeds, and users might thus think their privacy is secure. But such feeds can nonetheless be accessed by device manufacturer employees, data brokers, third parties, or law enforcement agencies, as well as hackers. When CCTV cameras near a subway entrance in Massachusetts captured a woman falling down an escalator in 2012, someone at the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority inexplicably &lt;a href="https://privacysos.org/blog/today-in-wtf-mbta-gives-embarrassing-video-of-womans-fall-to-the-press/"&gt;shared the video footage&lt;/a&gt; with the press and on YouTube. It was quickly taken down, but not before many copies had been made. The footage revealed such PII as her face, hair color, and skin color.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;h2&gt;No unnecessary surveillance&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most approaches to maintaining privacy focus on removing region of interest (ROI) details to "sanitize" personal information on true-color (RBG) images off-device. But these are vulnerable to environmental and lighting effects that can result in information leakage, according to the authors. They developed PrivacyLens to address these issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;figure class="image shortcode-img center large" style="width:100%"&gt;&lt;a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/privacy2.jpg" class="enlarge" data-height="1818" data-width="1200" alt="Yasha Iravantchi looks like an anonymous stick figure in this monitor connected to PrivacyLens.

The thermal imaging means that people in images can be detected and "subtracted" from images based on their thermal silhouettes, replacing them with an animated stick figure. The camera can still function, but the person's identifying features are protected. A deployment study—conducted in an office atrium, a family home, and an outdoor park—showed that PrivacyLens removed PII in 99.1 percent of images, compared to about 57.6 percent using RGB-only methods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are six different operational modes, depending on how much personal information the user wishes to remove. For instance, one might be fine with merely swapping facial features for a generic face (Face Swap mode) when at home in the kitchen, opting for full removal in the bedroom or bathroom (Ghost mode). That's consistent with the findings of a small pilot study the team conducted, which also revealed a lower expectation of privacy when in public settings and hence less need for the more aggressive operational modes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Cameras provide rich information to monitor health. It could help track exercise habits and other activities of daily living, or call for help when an elderly person falls," &lt;a href="https://www.eurekalert.org/news-releases/1051407"&gt;said co-author Yasha Iravantchi,&lt;/a&gt; a UM graduate student. "But this presents an ethical dilemma for people who would benefit from this technology. Without privacy mitigations, we present a situation where they must weigh giving up their privacy in exchange for good chronic care. This device could allow us to get valuable medical data while preserving patient privacy." PrivacyLens could also prevent autonomous vehicles or outdoor cameras from being used for surveillance in violation of privacy laws.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;DOI: Proceedings on Privacy Enhancing Technologies Symposium, 2024. &lt;a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.56553/popets-2024-0146"&gt;10.56553/popets-2024-0146&lt;/a&gt;  (&lt;a href="http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2010/03/dois-and-their-discontents-1.ars"&gt;About DOIs&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

Kevin Castel said that FTX must pay $8.7 billion in restitution to victims of Bankman-Fried's fraudulent scheme, as well as disgorge another $4 billion in "gains received in connection with the violations" to further compensate customers who suffered significant losses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8938-24"&gt;According to Ian McGinley&lt;/a&gt;, the division of enforcement director for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), "this multi-billion-dollar recovery for victims" is "the largest such recovery in CFTC history." And the CFTC "achieved it with remarkable speed," McGinley boasted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"FTX’s massive fraud collapsed 21 months ago, and in that time, the CFTC investigated, filed a complaint, and achieved what many thought was impossible at the time of the collapse—a resolution to compensate victims for the losses they suffered," McGinley said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;FTX could have owed more, but because the CFTC prioritized the speedy repayment of victims, the CTFC "agreed not to seek a civil monetary penalty against FTX" in a related settlement agreement approved by the Bankruptcy Court for the District of Delaware, the CFTC said in a &lt;a href="https://www.cftc.gov/PressRoom/PressReleases/8938-24"&gt;press release&lt;/a&gt; celebrating the order.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Restitution comes after Castel found that FTX had violated the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) and CFTC regulations. His order "imposes injunctions against further violations of the CEA and CFTC regulations, as well as trading and registration prohibitions, and requires FTX and Alameda to cooperate with the CFTC in its ongoing litigation," the CFTC said.&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;Customers will be eligible for disgorgement through a supplemental remission fund if FTX's plan is approved in ongoing bankruptcy proceedings, the CFTC said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In his order, Castel noted that FTX had been touted as "the safest and easiest way to buy and sell crypto," while FTX "commingled assets and freely used assets deposited by FTX customers as if they were Alameda’s assets"—which included using their assets to fund their promotions deceiving customers. Customer funds were also misappropriated to bail out "several digital asset companies with loans or acquisitions" and pay off FTX's debts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;CFTC Chairman Rostin Behnam chastised FTX for using "age-old tactics to create an illusion that it was a safe and secure place to access crypto markets," while taking advantage of the fact that "the basic regulatory tools, like governance, customer protections, and surveillance that exist to identify misconduct and ultimately prevent collapse, were simply not there."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;FTX fraudsters banned from trading crypto&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fraud didn't come to light until the crypto market crash of May 2022, when "many FTX customers began requesting to withdraw assets from the exchange," Castel wrote, and quickly found out their assets weren't readily available.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead of being honest with customers, Bankman-Fried and others at FTX publicly pretended there was a liquidity problem while internally acknowledging that the real problem was misappropriating customer funds. Even once it became obvious that FTX did not have enough funds to cover withdrawals, the exchange falsely reassured customers that all "deposits were safe," Castel said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Because of these misleading statements and many others, Castel ordered a permanent injunction that seemingly applies to anyone involved with FTX's fraud—including FTX, Alameda Research, Sam Bankman-Fried, Caroline Ellison, Gary Wang, and "any of their affiliates, agents, servants, employees, successors, assigns, attorneys, and persons in active concert or participation with them."&lt;/p&gt;                                                                        &lt;div class="ars-interlude-container"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;                                                                                  &lt;p&gt;The injunction blocks them from trading on any registered entity and from holding or entering into any transactions involving commodity interests or digital commodities, including bitcoin (BTC), ether (ETH), or tether (USDT). They also cannot control or direct trading of these commodities, among other restrictions on trading and registration.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Disbursement of restitution and disgorgements will be managed either by an administrator approved by the bankruptcy court or by FTX's CEO, John J. Ray III, who condemned the FTX scheme as "a complete failure of corporate controls" thriving off "a complete absence of trustworthy financial information," Castel's order noted.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the CFTC celebrated the speed of winning these repayments to FTX customers, it does not seem that disbursement will be immediate. In his order, Castel wrote that Ray would be responsible for sending annual progress reports "detailing the disbursement of funds or assets," suggesting repayment may stretch on for years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If FTX unduly delays payments once a plan is established, it may be required to repay whatever is owed at that time to customers to the CFTC immediately, the order said.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For victims wondering where to turn next to continue trading digital assets, more regulations might come as a comfort. But the cryptocurrency industry continues to lobby to evade regulations, OpenSecrets &lt;a href="https://www.opensecrets.org/news/2024/05/congress-blocked-sec-guidance-on-crypto-as-industry-lobbying-surged/"&gt;reported&lt;/a&gt; in May.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Until there's more regulatory clarity, Behnam, the CFTC chairman, vowed to continue working to uncover schemes to stop the next FTX.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This is just the tip of the iceberg," Behnam said. "In the absence of digital asset legislation to fill regulatory gaps, entities will continue to operate in the shadows without these basic tools of sound regulation, sharpening their deceptive practices and continuing to dupe customers."&lt;/p&gt;                                                  &lt;/div&gt;</description>

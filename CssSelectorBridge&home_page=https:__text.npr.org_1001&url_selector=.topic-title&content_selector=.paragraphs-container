      <title>Half a century ago, Nixon became the only president to resign</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="paragraphs-container"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;It was no longer a surprise, but it was still a shock.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;On a Thursday night in August 50 years ago, Americans turned on the evening news to be told the president of the United States would resign the next day.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nothing remotely like this had ever happened before; but for those who had been paying attention, it was increasingly difficult to imagine any other outcome.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The resignation of Richard Nixon was the culmination of two years of swirling controversy that began with a burglary at the Democratic National Committee offices in the Watergate complex in June 1972.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/1103098399"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;While initially viewed as a minor event, burglary was connected to Nixon’s reelection campaign and the White House was involved in the subsequent cover-up. There had been two years of persistent probes and damning reports, mounting evidence and a steady erosion of Nixon’s support in his party and from the public at large.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A Harris Poll published the week of the resignation found two-thirds of Americans thought it was time for Nixon to be impeached and tried.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;But &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aPEVzr7qSRk"&gt;could this man reading a farewell statement straight to camera from the Oval Office&lt;/a&gt; on August 8 be the same Nixon who had carried 49 states in winning a second term as president just 21 months earlier?&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“I have never been a quitter,” said the familiar voice. “To leave office before my term is completed is abhorrent to every instinct in my body. But as president, I must put the interest of America first.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He told the nation he had concluded that he “might not have the support of the Congress” to make the decisions he had to make as the leader of the Free World.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The following morning, Nixon bid goodbye to his staff at the White House and boarded a helicopter for the first leg of his long journey back to Southern California. His vice president, Gerald Ford, took the oath of office with the chief justice of the Supreme Court within the hour.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Shrinking base of support&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Nixon had battled against his fate for two years but was forced to see Congress would no longer sustain him in office. Articles of impeachment for obstruction of justice and abuse of power were moving through the House. They had the backing of big majorities, including many Republicans.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In July, a half a dozen of the House Judiciary Committee’s Republicans joined all of its Democrats in voting for at least one article. Then the U.S. Supreme Court ordered Nixon to turn over subpoenaed tape recordings of his Oval Office conversations that had been sought by Congress and prosecutors in the case. The recordings devastated Nixon’s account of what he knew about Watergate and when. Some of the Republicans who had voted against impeachment in the House Judiciary were telling reporters they would vote differently on the floor.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;At the same moment, in the Senate, it was increasingly clear the necessary two-thirds majority would be available to convict the president and remove him from office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That explicit message had been delivered to Nixon personally in early August by several senior Republicans led by the venerable Sen.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;Barry Goldwater of Arizona, the GOP presidential nominee in 1964. Goldwater was reported to have told the president he himself would vote for conviction and removal.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;What had been a facade of White House confidence and bravado finally collapsed, and Nixon saw what he had to do. On the night of August 8, he told the country that he&lt;br&gt;would resign the next day and that his vice president, Gerald Ford of Michigan, would be sworn in to take his place.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/1124784756"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The process had ground its way through investigations, Senate hearings, House hearings and countless court appearances for those caught up in the larger drama. It was a wearing process for all concerned, as Ford acknowledged in announcing “My fellow Americans, our long national nightmare is over.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Notably, all three branches of the federal government had been engaged – including intrepid actors within the executive branch, who saw their duty to the law and the Constitution more than to the chief executive who had put them in office.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Congress also, and in the courts, the progress of the legal process against the president had been driven or facilitated by individuals with sterling Republican credentials. Some had been appointed by Nixon, or elected with his endorsement. In sum, the system worked, not just as designed but as idealized from the founding of the republic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Third-rate burglary, first-rate detective story&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the end, Nixon was done in by the exposure of his own abuses of government power to preserve and protect his own political position.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ronald L. Ziegler, Nixon’s press secretary, had initially scoffed at what he called “third-rate burglary” — and it was a botched job to be sure. But the serious legal exposure began when the president and his innermost circle of advisers tried to buy the silence of the burglars and limit the damage. The cover-up proved far worse than the crime. The story got traction in the later months of 1972 because some elements of law enforcement, including the FBI, aided an investigation by the&lt;em&gt; Washington Post&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;All this was later popularized by a movie &lt;em&gt;All the President’s Men &lt;/em&gt;starring Robert Redford and Dustin Hoffman as &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;reporters, &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/2022/06/16/1105158079/in-new-edition-of-classic-watergate-expose-woodward-and-bernstein-link-nixon-tru" target="1105158079"&gt;Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein&lt;/a&gt;, which retold the tale as a journalistic detective story.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/1105158079"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;In 1972, early efforts to unravel that story by the &lt;em&gt;Post &lt;/em&gt;and other news organizations were overshadowed by the pending election and Nixon‘s overwhelming victory. But during this same phase, prosecutors and judges were asking difficult questions that Nixon’s campaign and White House personnel were hard pressed to answer.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;One judge in particular, John Sirica, surprised many who knew his earlier history as a Republican staff member. Sirica was not willing to let the original burglars or others get away without testifying, putting pressure on the White House at a critical moment. And he later issued key rulings on evidence that proved critical to cracking the case.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Early in 1973, the former White House attorney John Dean refused to be made Nixon’s fall guy for the cover-up&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;and became a star witness for the first real public reckoning of Watergate.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;That came with the Senate hearings that began in May that year and stretched into the fall – televised live daily by all three national TV networks. Those hearings were searching and relentless largely because their co-chairs, Democrat Sam Ervin of North Carolina and Republican Howard Baker of Tennessee were intent on getting to the bottom of it all. It was Baker who asked what became the core question: “What did the president know and when did he know it?”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;A nation both mesmerized and exhausted&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The months of televised Senate hearings changed the mood of the country. They also exposed the &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/2021/05/27/999279850/king-richard-brings-the-watergate-cast-back-in-its-own-words-on-tape"&gt;existence of the tape recordings&lt;/a&gt; that would prove crucial to the case, recordings Nixon had secretly ordered made of his Oval Office conversations.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;These were subpoenaed by the special counsel Archibald Cox, and when Cox refused to back off, Nixon fired him and named Texan Leon Jaworski. Although expected to be more tractable, Jaworski proved to be a pitbull in his own right. He wound up indicting, trying and convicting several key members of Nixon’s inner circle, including his first attorney general, John Mitchell. He also named Nixon himself an “unindicted co-conspirator.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The long months of legal process and congressional wrangling had made Watergate a daily news staple through 1973 and the first half of 1974. The country was exhausted and dreading what the next phase might bring. That sense may have been key to Ford’s decision in September 1974 to grant Nixon an unconditional pardon for all crimes related to Watergate.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/1006657405"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;For many Americans, the pardon left the entire matter unresolved. For others, the dominant emotion was relief that “Watergate” was finally over.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It was also an occasion to celebrate the fact that even a president who had been returned to office in a landslide could be held accountable to the law. Equally important, it was an affirmation that political appointees could have a sense of duty.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the half century since, we have seen three impeachment trials unfold in the Senate: one for Bill Clinton in 1999 and two for Donald Trump in 2020 and 2021. In each case, each article of impeachment approved along partisan lines in the House fell well short of the two-thirds majority needed to convict under the Constitution. A few votes were cast across party lines in each instance but there was never any real suspense.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Given the prevalence of partisanship in our own era, it is hard to imagine a return to the political dynamics of half a century ago that led two-thirds of the country and Nixon himself to conclude he had to go.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>'Chi Chi' Rodriguez, a Hall of Fame golfer who livened up the sport, dies at 88</title>
      <link>https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5069462</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5069462</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class="paragraphs-container"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Juan “Chi Chi” Rodriguez, a Hall of Fame golfer whose antics on the greens and inspiring life story made him among the sport’s most popular players during a long professional career, died Thursday. He was 88.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez's death was announced by Carmelo Javier Ríos, a senator in Rodriguez’s native Puerto Rico. He didn't provide a cause of death.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Chi Chi Rodriguez’s passion for charity and outreach was surpassed only by his incredible talent with a golf club in his hand,” PGA Tour Commissioner Jay Monahan said in a statement. “A vibrant, colorful personality both on and off the golf course, he will be missed dearly by the PGA Tour and those whose lives he touched in his mission to give back. The PGA Tour sends its deepest condolences to the entire Rodriguez family during this difficult time.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was born Juan Antonio Rodriguez, the second oldest of six children, in Rio Piedras, Puerto Rico, when it was blanketed with sugar cane fields and where he helped his father with the harvest as a child. The area is now a dense urban landscape, part of San Juan, the capital of the U.S. island territory.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5063178"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez said he learned to play golf by hitting tin cans with a guava tree stick and then found work as a caddie. He claimed he could shoot a 67 by age 12, according to a biography provided by the Chi Chi Rodriguez Management Group in Stow, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;No one from Puerto Rico had ever made it to the PGA Tour and Rodriguez was determined to not only get there but to beat the best. “They told me I was a hound dreaming about pork chops,” he once told Sports Illustrated.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He served in the U.S. Army from 1955-57 and joined the PGA Tour in 1960 and won eight times during his 21-year career, playing on one Ryder Cup team.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/1059934050"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first of his eight tour victories came in 1963, when he won the Denver Open. He followed it up with two the next year and continued through 1979 with the Tallahassee Open. He had 22 victories on the Champions Tour from 1985-2002, and had total combined career earnings of more than $7.6 million. He was inducted into the PGA World Golf Hall of Fame in 1992.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;His playing record doesn't look like Hall of Fame material. He contributions to the game with his showmanship and charity and devotion to youth development was gigantic.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He started an academy for children in the Tampa, Florida, area in the 1970s, focusing on those who were at risk. “Why do I love kids so much? Because I was never a kid myself. I was too poor to really have a childhood,” Rodriguez once said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And his humor never left him. He had a passion for baseball, and when the U.S. Senior Open went to Canterbury outside Cleveland in 1996, he was asked why he was why he gave up the sport. “I used to steal bases,” Rodriguez said as the room erupted in laughter.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/1145525966"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Rodriguez was perhaps best known for fairway antics that included twirling his club like a sword, sometimes referred to as his “matador routine,” or doing a celebratory dance, often with a shuffling salsa step, after making a birdie putt. He often irritated fellow players in what he insisted was meant as good-natured fun.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He was hospitalized in October 1998 after experiencing chest pains and reluctantly agreed to see a doctor, who told him he was having a heart attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“It scared me for the first time,” Rodriguez recalled in a 1999 interview with The Associated Press. “Jim Anderson (his pilot) drove me to the hospital and a team of doctors were waiting to operate. If I had waited another 10 minutes, the doctor said I would have needed a heart transplant.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“They call it the widow-maker,” he said. “About 50% of the people who get this kind of heart attack die. So I beat the odds pretty good.”&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/1225680719"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;After his recovery, he returned to competition for a couple of years but phased out his professional career and devoted more of his time to community and charity activities, such as the Chi Chi Rodriguez Youth Foundation, a charity based in Clearwater, Florida, founded in 1979.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In recent years, he spent most of his time in Puerto Rico, where he was a partner in a golf community project that struggled amid the recession and housing crisis, hosted a talk show on a local radio station for several years, and appeared at various sporting and other events.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;He showed up at the 2008 Puerto Rico Open and strolled through the grounds in a black leather coat and dark sunglasses, shaking hands and posing for pictures but playing no golf. “I didn’t want to take a spot away from young men trying to make a living,” he said.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;div class="paragraphs-container"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Ukraine has competing needs from its military aged population. It needs many of them to join the military to fight the Russian invasion. But it also needs them in the workforce, to keep the economy going so it can afford to pay for the war effort. As our reporter in Kyiv tells us, the most recent conscription law has exacerbated the problem.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Alarmed by mpox surge, Africa CDC is poised to declare a 'continental emergency'</title>
      <link>https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5068572</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5068572</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class="paragraphs-container"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;The Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has never done anything like this before. The agency is poised to declare a “public health emergency of continental security” as early as next week.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Since the beginning of last year, mpox cases have been &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/2024/03/27/1239276957/mpox-outbreak-democratic-republic-of-congo-deadlier-strain"&gt;surging in the Democratic Republic of Congo&lt;/a&gt;, with children making up the majority of the 14,000 reported cases and 511 deaths so far in 2024. Those numbers roughly match the number of cases reported in all of last year in the country.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Why Africa is so worried&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In the last couple weeks, there’s been a new and alarming development. Mpox has been detected in countries that have never previously identified cases. About 50 confirmed cases and more suspected cases have been reported in Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda, according to World Health Organization officials.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is with past health emergencies in mind that Africa CDC is trying to move quickly and garner international support. “Everything we are doing today [is because] we were abandoned during COVID time and, today, we don't want to be again abandoned. We don't want to be dependent. We are taking appropriate action,” says &lt;a href="https://africacdc.org/people/dr-jean-kaseya/"&gt;Dr. Jean Kaseya&lt;/a&gt;, director general of Africa CDC, noting that declaring a public health emergency is a new power given to the agency in 2023 by the African Union.&lt;strong&gt; &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Kaseya says that it’s particularly concerning that about 70% of cases in the DRC are in children under 18. “This one is a major alarm for the world,” he says. “We are losing the youth in Africa.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Experts say the higher number of cases and deaths among kids is likely because they don’t have protection from the smallpox vaccine — which was discontinued after that related virus was eliminated in 1980 – and because about 40% of kids in the region are malnourished, making it harder for their bodies to fight off the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The World Health Organization has also taken note of the evolving mpox situation. This week it announced that the group is convening an emergency committee to determine whether it will make a similar declaration to that of Africa CDC, designating the situation a public health emergency of international concern. “The committee will meet as soon as possible,” says WHO head Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;The U.S. response&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;There’s concern about mpox in the U.S. as well. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued an mpox health alert this week. While the risk to the general population in the U.S. remains low, Christina Hutson — senior science adviser at the U.S. CDC — says it’s important for clinicians, health departments and travelers to be aware of the spread of the virus in Africa and vigilant about symptoms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She says the spillover from DRC to neighboring countries is not surprising given how porous borders are. But “it is disappointing – because we've been working with DRC to try to help prevent spread.” She says the U.S. has been providing test kits and technical support to neighboring countries “so we were able to actually detect some of these cases pretty quickly.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, this Wednesday, the U.S. pledged nearly $424 million dollars to help with what USAID calls an “&lt;a href="https://www.usaid.gov/news-information/press-releases/aug-07-2024-united-states-announces-424-million-additional-assistance-democratic-republic-congo"&gt;ongoing catastrophe&lt;/a&gt;” in the DRC plus $10 million to respond to mpox and 5,000 mpox vaccine doses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;While Japan, the U.S., the European Union and the manufacturers are working on vaccine donations. Africa CDC says the need far outstrips what’s in the pipeline.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“We need to have vaccines. Today, we are just talking about almost 200,000 doses [becoming] available. We need at least 10 million doses.” says Kaseya. “The vaccine is so expensive – 85 euros per dose – If we consider some fees, we can put it around $100 per dose. There are not so many countries in Africa that can afford the cost of this vaccine.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The type of mpox spreading in the east of the DRC – particularly among sex workers and other adults – and into some of the neighboring countries is a subtype called Clade Ib. This is a new type of mpox that has kept scientists on their toes – discovering new information that is both good and bad. It’s harder for diagnostic tests to pick it up because of a genetic change in the virus, says Hutson of the U.S. CDC. It’s also the first time Clade I has been spread through sexual transmission. However, it also seems less fatal than the original Clade I circulating elsewhere in the DRC. The number of people who have died has dropped below 1%. At least that, she says, is a glimmer of good news.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>The Refugee Olympic Team wins its first-ever medal, thanks to boxer Cindy Ngamba</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="paragraphs-container"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;NPR is in Paris for the 2024 Summer Olympics. For more of our coverage from the Games, head to&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/series/g-s1-12714/2024-paris-olympics"&gt;our latest updates.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;hr /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Boxer Cindy Ngamba became the first-ever Refugee Olympic Team athlete to win a medal this week, giving the team its first piece of hardware since its creation nearly a decade ago.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ngamba lost her 75kg semifinal bout on Thursday to Panama's Atheyna Bylon, who will become her country’s first female Olympic medalist. But because of how Olympic boxing is scored, Ngamba will leave Paris with a bronze medal of her own — and a place in the history books.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The Refugee Olympic Team is incredibly proud of Cindy Ngamba, the first EOR athlete and the first-ever refugee medallist at the Olympics,” the team &lt;a href="https://x.com/RefugeesOlympic/status/1821652117024555146"&gt;posted on X&lt;/a&gt;, formerly Twitter. “Today, we are speechless. Cindy did it. Refugees did it!”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The International Olympic Committee &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/refugee-olympic-team"&gt;created the Refugee Olympic Team&lt;/a&gt; in 2015 to draw attention to the plight of refugees worldwide and offer a symbol of hope.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5029638"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The team has nearly &lt;a href="https://www.rescue.org/article/why-there-refugee-olympic-team"&gt;tripled in size&lt;/a&gt; since then, growing from 10 members at the 2016 Rio Games to 37 in Paris. This year’s athletes are hosted by 15 National Olympic Committees and &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/en/olympic-refuge-foundation/refugee-team"&gt;competing across 12 sports&lt;/a&gt;, including badminton, cycling, karate, swimming and wrestling.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Their participation comes at a time when a record number of people are being displaced from their homes by conflict, violence and persecution. The United Nations refugee agency reported in June that &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/2024/06/11/nx-s1-5002273/nearly-120-million-people-were-displaced-around-the-world-in-2023-unhcr-report-says#:~:text=Nearly%20120%20million%20people%20were,2023%2C%20UNHCR%20report%20says%20%3A%20NPR"&gt;nearly 120 million people&lt;/a&gt; were displaced worldwide in 2023, the 12th consecutive year that number has risen.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ngamba was born in the Central African country of Cameroon and moved to Bolton, England, at age 11, according to her &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/en/athletes/cindy-ngamba"&gt;official biography&lt;/a&gt;. She took up soccer at a local youth club, where she discovered boxing by chance at age 15.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“One day, when I was walking out the football training session, I saw many boys coming out of a room and all I heard is boom, boom. I walked inside, and I saw boys in the room punching each other on the head. I said, ‘This is so cool,’ ” she &lt;a href="http://olympics.com"&gt;told Olympics.com&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;After several years of training — initially, there were &lt;a href="https://www.unhcr.org/us/news/stories/cindy-ngamba-wins-historic-first-medal-refugee-olympic-team"&gt;no other girls&lt;/a&gt; for her to spar with — Ngamba got in the ring and immediately started winning. She became a three-time national champion in three weight classes (light-heavy, middle and light-middle).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“When I first started boxing, I started to challenge myself and for me to have processed all the way to the top it doesn’t change my mindset,” She said. “I do it for myself because I know how hard I worked for it, and when I set that goal, I am going to achieve it.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ngamba has also fought to remain in the United Kingdom, which has repeatedly denied her citizenship even though the now-25-year-old has lived there for over a decade. She was once sent to a detention camp and nearly deported because of her “paperwork situation.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ngamba, &lt;a href="https://glaad.org/meet-cindy-ngamba-history-making-lgbtq-boxer-representing-asylum-seeking-olympians/#:~:text=In%202022%2C%20Ngamba%20came%20out,up%20to%205%20years%20imprisonment."&gt;who is gay&lt;/a&gt;, cannot return to Cameroon, where same-sex sexual relations are punishable by up to five years in prison.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“If I was sent back, I can be in danger,” Ngamba said. “So, I was given the refugee status to be safe and protected."&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-4994395"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ngamba qualified for the Refugee Olympic Team earlier this year, becoming &lt;a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/cindy-ngamba-achieves-first-ever-medal-for-the-ioc-refugee-olympic-team"&gt;the first boxer&lt;/a&gt; to do so. She had previously said that making it to the Games would be the “most amazing thing that will ever happen to me, and I will cherish it for the rest of my life.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Flash forward to Paris, where Ngamba played a major role in the opening ceremony as one of the &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/live-updates/olympics-2024-paris-opening-ceremony#who-are-the-refugee-olympic-team-flag-bearers"&gt;team’s two flag bearers&lt;/a&gt;. Adding another layer of significance, Ngamba’s mother and some of her siblings live in the French capital.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ngamba said it “means the world” to be the first refugee athlete to win an Olympic medal — and vowed to bring home a different-color medal next time.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Her win has been hailed — including by U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees &lt;a href="https://x.com/FilippoGrandi/status/1820108978132586540"&gt;Filippo Grandi&lt;/a&gt; — as a victory not just for her team but for the 120 million forcibly displaced people worldwide. Ngamba had a message for them, too.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"I want to say to all the refugees all around the world and refugees that are not athletes, and mainly humans around the world, that you have to keep on working hard, keep on believing in yourself,” she said. “You can achieve whatever you put your mind to."&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Trump holds a rambling news conference while Harris and Walz make stops on debut tour</title>
      <link>https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5068669</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://text.npr.org/nx-s1-5068669</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class="paragraphs-container"&gt;                  &lt;hr&gt;         &lt;h3&gt;Transcript&lt;/h3&gt;         &lt;p&gt;MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; Ten years ago today in Ferguson, Mo., about 20 minutes from here, a white police officer shot and killed Michael Brown Jr., a young Black man. We'll look at what's changed since then, but first...&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;LEILA FADEL, HOST: &lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt; There are less than 90 days until the November election, and it feels like the campaign is in full force.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;MARTIN: For the first time since Vice President Harris announced her running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, her opponent, former President Donald Trump, spoke at a news conference. It was rambling and chaotic. Meanwhile, Harris and Walz continue their debut tour with a stop in the battleground state of Michigan.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FADEL: For more on Trump and Harris' latest appearances, NPR political correspondent Danielle Kurtzleben is with us. Hi, Danielle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DANIELLE KURTZLEBEN, BYLINE: Hey. Good morning.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FADEL: Good morning. So let's start with Trump's press conference yesterday. What did we learn from it?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KURTZLEBEN: Well, the main news we learned from it is that Trump is now open to doing three debates with Kamala Harris. Now, that comes after weeks of waffling about whether he would debate her at all. Now, he named three dates in September on which he would debate, and three networks - ABC News, NBC News and Fox News. Shortly after he said this, Harris said she would do the September 10 debate on ABC - now, Trump had backed out of that previously - and she also told reporters she's open to other debates, but she didn't commit to anything.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FADEL: And Trump took questions for nearly an hour. What kind of things did reporters ask him?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KURTZLEBEN: Well, this was rambling and chaotic, yes, so I can't really get to everything here, but I'm going to hit on a few things. He got to a lot of topics that we had all, in the press corps, been wondering about for the last few weeks. Now, one is his comments that Harris only recently started saying she was Black. Now, our reporter asked, how is that true? She went to a historically Black university.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FADEL: Right.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KURTZLEBEN: He didn't seem to want to answer. He said repeatedly, you'll have to ask her. Now, another reporter asked how he feels about Harris' recent large crowds, and that really seemed to get under his skin.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;DONALD TRUMP: Oh, give me a break.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;(LAUGHTER)&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;TRUMP: Listen, I had 107,000 people in New Jersey. You didn't report it. I'm so glad you asked. What did she have yesterday, 2,000 people? If I ever had 2,000 people, you'd say my campaign is finished.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KURTZLEBEN: Now, a quick fact check. That New Jersey rally - it really was big, but the idea that it was 100,000 has been fact-checked. It does seem to be too high.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FADEL: Yeah.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KURTZLEBEN: But again, you can hear there he seemed quite angry. One other thing is he was asked about abortion - if his FDA would revoke access to mifepristone, one of the drugs used in medication abortions. He indicated he was open to it. Now, even by Trump's standards, really what I'm saying is he was evasive and unclear and pretty combative.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FADEL: So that's what the press wanted to know. What did Trump seem to want to get out of this press conference?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KURTZLEBEN: Well, a few things - first of all, to say that he would do the debates; now, second, to slam Harris and Tim Walz, to say that they're too liberal. He said a couple of times he doesn't think it's fair to run against her, since Biden was the one running in the primary, and he also slammed her for not doing enough press interviews, which has become a widespread criticism among Republicans of Harris.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now, he took that a bit further. He had some pretty ugly criticisms, multiple times saying she isn't intelligent. At one point, he said she's, quote, "not smart enough to do a news conference." The bottom line seems to be that Harris and Walz have gotten so much attention, he just wanted some for himself.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FADEL: So Harris, meanwhile, along with Walz, made an appearance in Detroit with the UAW labor union. What did she say?&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KURTZLEBEN: Well, she thanked them for their endorsement. She talked a lot about how unions are great. They create fairness. Now, what's striking is just that she and Walz just seem to be putting out this positive message, which really seems to be what they're leaning into, since she is the new candidate at a time when many American voters were just exhausted by Biden and Trump.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;FADEL: That's NPR's Danielle Kurtzleben. Thanks, Danielle.&lt;p&gt;&lt;p&gt;KURTZLEBEN: Thank you.&lt;p&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;</description>

      <title>Harris and Trump will debate in September. And, a COVID mystery unraveled</title>

      <description>&lt;div class="paragraphs-container"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Good morning. You're reading the Up First newsletter. &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/newsletter/news"&gt;Subscribe&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; here to get it delivered to your inbox, and &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/podcasts/510318/up-first/"&gt;listen&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt; to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Today's top stories&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vice President Harris and Former President Donald Trump have agreed to a debate on Sept. 10 on ABC.&lt;/strong&gt; At his first news conference since Harris announced Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, Trump said he was open to doing three debates in September on three different networks: ABC, NBC and FOX. Harris said she’s open to the other debates but hasn't committed to them.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;🎧 &lt;strong&gt;Trump took questions for nearly an hour as he addressed Harris' race, the size of her rallies and abortion, NPR’s Danielle Kurtzleben tells &lt;em&gt;Up First&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;a href="https://one.npr.org/?sharedMediaId=1198913518:1257032208"&gt;When asked about his comments&lt;/a&gt; that Harris has only recently started saying she's Black, he repeatedly said, “You’ll have to ask her.” Kurtzleben says questions about recent crowds at Harris' rallies got under his skin. He claimed 107,000 people came to his New Jersey stop. Though it was a big rally, a fact check determined attendance wasn’t that high. When asked if his FDA would revoke mifepristone access, he indicated he was open to it. Meanwhile, Harris and Walz stopped in the battleground state of Michigan to speak with the United Auto Workers Union. Kurtzleben says it's striking how the two are excited to be on the trail and making sure people know it. In contrast, the Biden-Trump race felt boring.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Researchers have discovered what caused some children to develop a serious but rare condition called multi-system inflammatory syndrome, or MIS-C, weeks after a COVID infection. &lt;/strong&gt;When the pandemic began, children showed up in the emergency department with symptoms including persistent high fevers, vomiting, fatigue and heart inflammation. Scientists knew it was related to COVID, but didn't know how. According to a report in the journal &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt;, researchers determined that children who developed MIS-C &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/2024/08/08/nx-s1-5068027/mis-c-covid-children-icu"&gt;had an out-of-control immune response&lt;/a&gt; because their immune systems locked onto a part of the COVID virus that closely resembles a protein found in immune cells located in the body. This causes the immune system to attack itself instead of the virus.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;U.S. track and field athletes marked a triumph last night during the final days of the Paris Olympics.&lt;/strong&gt; Three gold medals were awarded and Sydney McLaughlin-Levrone &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/2024/08/08/g-s1-16076/sydney-mclaughlin-levrone-400m-hurdles-world-record-olympic-gold"&gt;broke her own world record&lt;/a&gt; in the women’s 400 meter hurdles. But Noah Lyles' night didn't go as planned: He won bronze in the 200-meter final and said he had &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/2024/08/08/nx-s1-5068339/botswanas-letsile-tebogo-noah-lyles-olympic-gold-200-meter"&gt;tested positive for COVID&lt;/a&gt; two days earlier. In basketball, the U.S. team pulled off a &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/2024/08/08/g-s1-16050/usa-mens-basketball-serbia-paris-olympics"&gt;nail-biting win against Serbia&lt;/a&gt;. They'll play for Olympic gold against France tomorrow night. The women's soccer team, newly reinvigorated by a trio of stars, will &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/2024/08/09/g-s1-16045/uswnt-olympic-soccer-gold-rodman-swanson-smith-paris"&gt;play their gold medal game&lt;/a&gt; against Brazil tomorrow morning. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;➡️ &lt;strong&gt;The U.S. now has over a hundred medals in the Paris Olympic Games so far&lt;/strong&gt;, with three days of competition left. Here’s a &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/2024/08/09/nx-s1-5068021/olympic-medal-count-paris-gold-silver-bronze-total"&gt;closer look at the count&lt;/a&gt; — and how the competitors are doing.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;From our hosts&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This essay was written by &lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/people/5201175/michel-martin"&gt;Michel Martin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;, Morning Edition and Up First host.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You know how, when it comes to files, some people are savers and some are minimizers?&lt;/strong&gt; This is to say, some people keep every scrap of paper (ok, digital file) and some people throw things out the minute they don’t need them anymore.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I live in both camps.&lt;/strong&gt; I tend to keep things until I get sick of myself or move — which is why I was surprised to find a ten-year-old binder on my shelf. It was my notes from a town hall that St. Louis Public Radio asked me to moderate back in August 2014. The station put it together just a few weeks after a young man black man named Michael Brown Jr. was shot to death by a white police officer in a St. Louis suburb called Ferguson, after Brown had a confrontation at a gas station. Numerous investigations later, many people here &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/2024/08/09/nx-s1-5064675/michael-brown-ferguson-killing-10-years"&gt;still don’t agree on exactly what happened&lt;/a&gt; that Saturday afternoon; whether, as investigators believe, Brown tried to grab the officer’s gun or the officer shot the unarmed Brown for no reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There’s no argument about what came next: 400 days of protests in and around Ferguson. &lt;/strong&gt;These protests shed a light on issues that locals had been trying to fight for years: heavy-handed policing practices that were not only unconstitutional but also, more about generating revenue than public safety. Many believe that set the table for the worldwide wave of protests against police violence after George Floyd was killed in 2020.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Has anything changed? &lt;/strong&gt;We’ve been reporting here all week and we &lt;a href="https://www.stlpr.org/culture-history/2024-08-08/ferguson-panel-reflects-10-years-michael-brown-jr-death"&gt;helped out with another town hall&lt;/a&gt;.

      <title>Ukraine presses offensive inside Russia as Moscow scrambles to respond</title>
      <link>https://text.npr.org/g-s1-16131</link>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://text.npr.org/g-s1-16131</guid>
      <description>&lt;div class="paragraphs-container"&gt;         &lt;p&gt;KYIV, Ukraine — Ukraine pressed ahead with a military offensive inside Russia on Friday while Russian forces scrambled to respond to the surprise attack that has forced thousands of civilians to flee their homes.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Video on social media showed long lines of Russia civilians driving out of villages in the western region of Kursk, where Ukraine launched the operation Tuesday. Russia has canceled train service in several parts of Kursk due to the fighting. In addition, videos show Russian civilians pleading for help from Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Russian military, saying they fear for their lives.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/1082539802"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian, Ukrainian and U.S. officials all acknowledge the fighting, but details remain sketchy.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In his nightly video address, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said, "Russia brought war to our land and should feel what it has done. Ukrainians know how to achieve their goals."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Beyond a few general comments, Ukraine's government and military have not commented on the operation, which appears to be the largest inside Russia since Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Russian military officials said they have sent reinforcements to Kursk, that they were defeating the Ukrainian forces and expected to regain control of the border soon.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Reports of ongoing clashes&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Many Russian military bloggers, however, are presenting a contradictory assessment, saying the fighting is ongoing in multiple villages, with Russian forces suffering setbacks and struggling to gain the upper hand. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Videos posted on pro-Ukrainian social media sites show the Ukrainians advancing on a number of fronts. They show the destruction of what is described as &lt;a href="https://t.me/DeepStateUA/20089"&gt;a Russian military column&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://send.monobank.ua/jar/8q9FEN5vej"&gt;surrender of dozens of Russian troops&lt;/a&gt; and Ukrainian soldiers standing in front of road signs marking the entrances to villages in the Kursk region.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The posts say that Ukrainian troops are operating in multiple settlements, villages and towns, and have penetrated at least 6 miles into Russian territory. Some claim the Ukrainians have gone even farther.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/g-s1-15918"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;The heaviest fighting is reported to be Sudzha, several miles inside Russia, and the largest town in the areas under attack.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Local Russian officials have reported dozens of civilian casualties in their areas in posts on Telegram, but neither Russia nor Ukraine have provided overall casualty figures.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;NPR and other news organizations cannot independently verify the accounts.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has not said how many of its troops have crossed into Russia. Russian Gen. Valery Gerasimov, the chief of the general staff, told a Kremlin briefing Wednesday that some 1,000 Ukrainian troops were taking part, backed by dozens of armored vehicles. Some Ukrainian media reports, without citing sources, have suggested an even larger number, saying several Ukrainian brigades are involved.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Ukraine's goals are not clear&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In addition, the ultimate aim of the Ukrainian operation is not clear. The offensive clearly caught the Russians off guard and and has lifted the mood of Ukrainians, at least temporarily.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;"Will the events in this or that Russian border region have a psychological impact on [Russian] society? They will, without a doubt," said Mykhailo Podolyak, a top adviser to Zelenskyy. "When you increase Russian losses, when you ramp up their war costs, such as destroyed military equipment, lost territory, lost people, will this affect how they perceive their war? Without a doubt."&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;However, some military analysts are questioning whether this incursion makes military sense. They note Ukraine has far fewer troops than Russia and needs all the forces it can muster to defend its own territory. By sending a sizable force on an offensive operation inside Russia, Ukraine could be even more vulnerable to the Russian troops attacking inside Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;       Related Story: &lt;a href="https://text.npr.org/g-s1-11370"&gt;NPR&lt;/a&gt;       &lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has given no indication of whether it seeks to hold territory inside Russia — which could be extremely difficult and costly — or if the operation is a limited action that will conclude with the troops withdrawing to Ukrainian territory.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ukraine has previously backed Russian exiles who carried out limited cross-border raids, but has never conducted its own operation on such a scale.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Meanwhile, Ukraine is on the defensive at home, struggling to halt, or at least limit, a Russian offensive in the eastern Donbas region. Russians forces have seized a number of villages in recent weeks, making it one of their most successful ground operations in well over a year. The Russians have sent wave after wave of troops toward Ukrainian lines, suffering massive losses with the attacks. But the Russians have advanced, claiming villages that have been largely reduced to rubble in the heavy fighting.&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;</description>

It allows Coca-Cola to “take advantage of children by beaming messages into their digital worlds that exploit their emotional vulnerabilities,” the editorial says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Indeed, this year’s summer Olympics have reached unprecedented audiences on broadcast and online, &lt;a href="https://www.nbcsports.com/pressbox/press-releases/this-just-in-powered-by-peacock-paris-olympic-streaming-hits-17-billion-minutes-topping-all-prior-olympics-combined"&gt;NBC reports&lt;/a&gt;. Online viewing exceeded 17 billion minutes of streaming video, more than all previous Olympics combined.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The commentary echoes a &lt;a href="https://www.kickbigsodaout.org/"&gt;“Kick Big Soda Out of Sport”&lt;/a&gt; campaign launched the week before the 2024 Olympics opened in Paris and supported by 80 public health and sustainability groups around the world, from Mexico’s National Institute of Health to Australia’s Public Health Association.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A video ad for the campaign opens with a young man downing a Coke and spitting it out. “Hey Big Soda,” it begins, “your sports-washing doesn’t wash with us.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Like the BMJ editorial, the ad links soda to the twin epidemics of obesity and diabetes, and it criticizes soda companies for depleting water resources and littering oceans with plastic bottles. It fingers the industry for fighting laws aimed at protecting health and claims that soda makers use sports “to deliberately target children.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The ad concludes: “The game’s up.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Yet the finish line is nowhere in sight.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In response to the BMJ commentary, the IOC replied with a statement to NPR. “The IOC is proud of its nearly century long partnership with The Coca-Cola Company,” it said. The company makes other drinks with less sugar than Coke, the statement said, including sugar-free options. It goes on to cite Coca-Cola’s &lt;a href="https://www.coca-colacompany.com/policies-and-practices/responsible-marketing-policy"&gt;Responsible Marketing Policy,&lt;/a&gt;which says the company does not directly market its products to children under 13.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IOC’s response to the editorial came as no surprise to &lt;a href="https://www.barclayagency.com/speakers/dr-marion-nestle"&gt;Marion Nestle,&lt;/a&gt; a professor emerita of nutrition, food studies and public health at New York University.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Too much money is at stake for the IOC to refuse it,” she said in an email.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;She called the Responsible Marketing Policy "a joke.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“The policy itself is based on an absurd notion, that children under age 13 do not watch any Coke-advertised television programs, sports events or music events in which 70% or more of viewers are over age 13,” she said.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;“Of course they do,” she added, “which is why the Olympics sponsorship is so important and so effective.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The IOC’s continued partnership with Coca-Cola risks making the Olympics “complicit in intensifying a global epidemic of poor nutrition, environmental degradation, and climate change,” the BMJ editorial says.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In a recent speech, IOC President Thomas Bach promised to protect children from the marketing of unhealthy products, the writers note. They call on the IOC to acknowledge that its continued association with Coca-Cola contradicts Bach’s promise and “the foundational values espoused by this iconic sporting event.”&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ronnie Cohen is a San Francisco Bay Area journalist focused on health and social justice issues.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;       &lt;/div&gt;</description>

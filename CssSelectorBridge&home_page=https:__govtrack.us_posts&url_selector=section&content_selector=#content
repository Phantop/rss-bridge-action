Here are eight of the most interesting bills he introduced, including some of his &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=412214#current_status%5B%5D=28"&gt;bills which were enacted into law&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walz's bills almost entirely focused on veterans' health care and employment, many of which had bipartisan support. He also introduced bills to limit stock trading by legislators and corporations' spending on elections, bills to promote energy independence and green energy, and bills on agricultural issues that wouldn't make national headlines including &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr5188"&gt;farm soil health&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Three weeks ago, GovTrack also analyzed eight of the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/431/2024-07-17_trumps-vp-pick-sen-jd-vance-his-most-interesting-bills-in-congress"&gt;most interesting bills Republican vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance introduced&lt;/a&gt; in the Senate. The contrast between Walz and Vance goes beyond the obvious ideology differences. Vance's bills largely dealt with "red meat" social and culture-war issues, such as immigration, affirmative action, race, and transgender issues. ("Red meat" issues are divisive issues that are intended to energize a politician's base.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All five enacted bills for which Walz served as lead sponsor dealt with military or veteran issues. The first three bills below were among them.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This was personal for Walz, who &lt;a href="https://mn.gov/governor/about-gov/timwalz/"&gt;served in the National Guard for 24 years&lt;/a&gt;, rising to the rank of &lt;a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/walz-vp-pick-enlisted/#:%7E:text=In%20his%20final%20assignment%2C%20Walz,spokesperson%20for%20the%20Minnesota%20National"&gt;command sergeant major&lt;/a&gt;. He also served as &lt;a href="https://veterans.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=549"&gt;ranking member on the House Veterans' Affairs Committee&lt;/a&gt; in 2017-18, when Republicans controlled the chamber. (Vance also served in the military, deploying to Iraq with the Marines, where he &lt;a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/jd-vance-marine-veteran/"&gt;rose to the rank of corporal&lt;/a&gt;. But contrasted with Walz, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=456876&amp;amp;subject=5852"&gt;almost none of Vance's Senate bills deal with military or veteran issues&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr203"&gt;Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clay Hunt, a Marine veteran from Houston who served in Afghanistan and Iraq, &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/the-life-and-death-of-clay-hunt/"&gt;died by suicide in 2011&lt;/a&gt;. He was only &lt;a href="https://people.com/celebrity/american-sniper-clay-hunts-tragic-suicide/"&gt;28&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, his situation wasn't an aberration. &lt;a href="https://www.mentalhealth.va.gov/docs/data-sheets/2023/2023-National-Veteran-Suicide-Prevention-Annual-Report-FINAL-508.pdf#page=8"&gt;6,392 veterans died by suicide&lt;/a&gt; in 2021, the most recent year available, marking a slight increase over the year prior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2015, Walz introduced Hunt's namesake bill to reform several aspects of VA mental health care:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr203/text/enr#link=2&amp;amp;nearest=HC683DE6C7CFA42F78A4C99C319B89077"&gt;Conducting&lt;/a&gt; annual evaluations of its mental health care and suicide prevention programs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr203/text/enr#link=3&amp;amp;nearest=HBB7E1A08C59D45AC97641C64EDBF4E8D"&gt;Creating&lt;/a&gt; a website about its mental health services.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr203/text/enr#link=4&amp;amp;nearest=H67CE305C479243B5A621FF4753121C62"&gt;Establishing&lt;/a&gt; a pilot program for repaying student loans of VA staff psychiatrists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr203/text/enr#link=7&amp;amp;nearest=H8112D9639EE3463C9F1D2B6C0850B2E0"&gt;Extending&lt;/a&gt; the eligibility period for health care services for veterans who served during certain periods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Veterans die by suicide each and every day," &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160907063935/http://walz.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/walz-miller-duckworth-reintroduce-clay-hunt-sav-act-to-address-veteran"&gt;Walz said in a 2015 press release&lt;/a&gt;. "While no piece of legislation will completely end this heartbreaking epidemic, we cannot stand idly by while more of our heroes struggle with the invisible wounds of war."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The House passed it unanimously &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h17"&gt;403-0&lt;/a&gt;, then the Senate followed suit by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/s50"&gt;99-0&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/john_mccain/300071"&gt;Then-Sen. John McCain (R-AZ)&lt;/a&gt;, a Vietnam veteran himself, sponsored the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s167"&gt;Senate version&lt;/a&gt;. President Barack Obama signed it into law. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you or somebody you know is experiencing thoughts of suicide, call the toll-free hotline 988, available 24 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3670"&gt;Reforming TSA hiring practices for veterans&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Years before Walz was elected, Congress enacted the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/103/hr995"&gt;Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) of 1994&lt;/a&gt;. The law guarantees enlisted military members called up to active duty retain their preexisting benefits and seniority once they return to their civilian jobs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks, Congress created the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which needed to surge its staffing quickly. So the nascent agency was granted an exemption from the 1994 law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;By 2012, Walz believed the TSA's original early-2000s exemption was no longer needed. Indeed, even the TSA itself agreed, since they'd &lt;a href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/CRPT-112hrpt487/html/CRPT-112hrpt487-pt1.htm"&gt;voluntarily returned to compliance with the 1994 law by that time&lt;/a&gt;. However, this voluntary change still wasn't actually guaranteed by law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The unemployment rate among our service members is already far too high. Protecting the jobs they already have should be a top priority," &lt;a href="https://bilirakis.house.gov/media/press-releases/bilirakis-owens-walz-bipartisan-legislation-passes-house-expand-job-protection"&gt;Walz said in a 2012 press release&lt;/a&gt;. "[This] bill simply ensures that the thousands of veterans, reservists, and members of the National Guard working for TSA are protected as they would be in any other position."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The House passed it by voice vote, then the Senate passed it by unanimous consent. &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/joseph_lieberman/300067"&gt;Then-Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT)&lt;/a&gt; sponsored the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s1990"&gt;Senate version&lt;/a&gt;. President Obama signed it into law.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1725"&gt;Quicker Veterans Benefits Delivery Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walz introduced a bill mandating the VA submit two annual reports about medical treatment for veterans, in hopes of speeding up wait times and eliminating unnecessary or duplicative examinations.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walz's original version actually would have included direct public policy effects, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1725/text/ih#link=2&amp;amp;nearest=H2837ED48B0B44FA288ACDE312B72472A"&gt;allowing local non-VA doctors to conduct disability medical examinations for veterans&lt;/a&gt;. However, that provision was omitted from the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr1725/text"&gt;final enacted version&lt;/a&gt;, which only mandated two annual reports. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Our goal with this legislation is simple: to uphold the promises we've made to our veterans by ending the backlog and getting them the benefits they have earned and deserve," &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/115/meeting/house/105843/witnesses/HHRG-115-VR09-Wstate-W000799-20170405.pdf#page=3"&gt;Walz said in a 2017 statement to the House Subcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs&lt;/a&gt;. "This is a common sense solution that will aid in adding efficiency to a complicated process in order to better serve our nation's heroes."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The House passed it by voice vote, then the Senate passed it by unanimous consent. &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/alan_franken/412378"&gt;Then-Sen. Al Franken (D-MN)&lt;/a&gt; introduced &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s706"&gt;the Senate version&lt;/a&gt;. President Donald Trump signed it into law in March 2018.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;(Franken &lt;a href="https://www.everycrsreport.com/files/20180412_R44781_2ae22d84a1afb9a470a0ab2ea0128ee49fbd9d8e.pdf#page=6"&gt;resigned his Senate seat in January 2018&lt;/a&gt; after sexual harassment allegations, so he was no longer serving by the time his own legislation was enacted.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr1148"&gt;STOCK (Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge) Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;In 2011, &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zh30lm7aSQ"&gt;CBS's 60 Minutes revealed&lt;/a&gt; how Congress members legally used non-public information gleaned from closed committee hearings when buying and selling stocks. Walz had previously introduced a bill to ban the practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He actually introduced it in March that year, several months before  &lt;a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/congress-trading-stock-on-inside-information/"&gt;the investigative report that November&lt;/a&gt;. Sorting cosponsors by the date they joined, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr1148/cosponsors"&gt;only 10 of the eventual 286&lt;/a&gt; added their names before the report aired on November 13.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The same standards we have established for Wall Street should apply to Congress," &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110407000935/http://walz.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=326:walz-and-slaughter-say-legislation-is-needed-to-curb-congressional-insider-trading&amp;amp;catid=7:latest-news"&gt;Walz said in a 2011 press release&lt;/a&gt;. "The potential for abuse is obvious and troubling, and there is simply no good reason Congress should get to play by a separate set of rules in the stock market."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Some Republicans argued it violated Congress members' freedoms, while some Democrats contended the bill wasn't strong enough, in particular the mere &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/06/06/nx-s1-4974720/congress-stock-trades-profits"&gt;$200 fine for a first-time offense&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In response to the exposé, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/joseph_lieberman/300067"&gt;Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT)&lt;/a&gt; introduced &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/s2038"&gt;a similar bill&lt;/a&gt; which passed the Senate &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/s14"&gt;96-3&lt;/a&gt; and the House &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/h47"&gt;417-2&lt;/a&gt;. The two chambers ironed out their differences in conference. President Obama signed it into law, but a year later Congress and Obama &lt;a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/itsallpolitics/2013/04/16/177496734/how-congress-quietly-overhauled-its-insider-trading-law"&gt;quietly rolled back some of the provisions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where is it today?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;While the STOCK Act banned Congress members from buying or selling stocks based on non-public information, it didn't ban them from trading stocks entirely. In the current Congress, several bipartisan bills would do just that, though none have yet received a committee vote:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr1679"&gt;Bipartisan Ban on Congressional Stock Ownership Act&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/pramila_jayapal/412730"&gt;Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-WA7)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr3003"&gt;Bipartisan Restoring Faith in Government Act&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/brian_fitzpatrick/412721"&gt;Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-PA1)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr6842"&gt;STOCK Act 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/katie_porter/412758"&gt;Rep. Katie Porter (D-CA47)&lt;/a&gt; in the House and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/kirsten_gillibrand/412223"&gt;Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY)&lt;/a&gt; in the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s3555"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2463"&gt;Ban Stock Trading for Government Officials Act&lt;/a&gt;, introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/joshua_hawley/412840"&gt;Sen. Josh Hawley (R-MO)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr5520"&gt;VA Medicinal Cannabis Research Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Medical marijuana is now &lt;a href="https://disa.com/marijuana-legality-by-state"&gt;legal in 37 states plus the District of Columbia&lt;/a&gt;. However, it remains illegal at the federal level, where the drug is classified as &lt;a href="https://www.dea.gov/drug-information/drug-scheduling"&gt;Schedule I&lt;/a&gt;, grouped in the same strongest category as heroin and meth.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As a result, the VA as a federal healthcare provider &lt;a href="https://www.publichealth.va.gov/marijuana.asp"&gt;can't prescribe medical marijuana for its veteran patients&lt;/a&gt; suffering from conditions like PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walz introduced a bill to allow the VA to "conduct and support research on the efficacy and safety of medicinal cannabis" -- essentially, to even permit an official study for the first time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We have all heard the stories of veterans who have used cannabis medicinally to cope with physical and psychological injuries sustained during their service to our country," &lt;a href="https://democrats-veterans.house.gov/news/press-releases/committee-leaders-introduce-bipartisan-va-medicinal-cannabis-research-act-2018"&gt;Walz said in a 2018 press release&lt;/a&gt;. "While we know cannabis can have life-saving effects on veterans suffering from chronic pain or PTSD, there has been a severe lack of research studying the full effect of medicinal cannabis on these veterans."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bill attracted 55 bipartisan cosponsors, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr5520/cosponsors"&gt;44 Democrats and 11 Republicans&lt;/a&gt;. The House Veterans' Affairs Committee approved it, but it never received a vote in the full chamber.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents generally oppose marijuana legalization in any form, whether at the state or federal level. "When the conversation about how to serve our veterans after all they sacrificed is to give them marijuana --- we have failed our veterans," &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/james_lankford/412464"&gt;Sen. James Lankford (R-OK)&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://x.com/SenatorLankford/status/1651222544962166784"&gt;posted on X to explain his opposition&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where is it today?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/luis_correa/412688"&gt;Rep. Luis Correa (D-CA46)&lt;/a&gt; has picked up the mantle since Walz left Congress, introducing the House bill in &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/116/hr712"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/117/hr2916"&gt;2021&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr1003"&gt;2023&lt;/a&gt;. The 2019 and 2021 versions were passed in committee, but never received votes in the full chamber.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/jon_tester/412244"&gt;Sen. Jon Tester (D-MT)&lt;/a&gt; introduced the original &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/s2796"&gt;Senate version&lt;/a&gt; alongside Walz and has continued to reintroduce it every Congress since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;His &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s326"&gt;2023 Senate version&lt;/a&gt; became the first to receive a vote in the upper chamber. It failed on a cloture vote, an attempt to break a filibuster. While it won majority support by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2023/s97"&gt;57-42&lt;/a&gt;, that fell short of the three-fifths required. Democrats unanimously supported it, while Republicans largely opposed it 8-41.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In May, the Justice Department &lt;a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/justice-department-submits-proposed-regulation-reschedule-marijuana"&gt;announced a proposal to downgrade marijuana from Schedule I to Schedule III&lt;/a&gt;. As of this writing, that change has not been finalized. Even if it is, though, the drug would remain illegal on a federal level -- just with more lenient penalties. So Congress would still have to enact legislation to let the VA prescribe medical marijuana.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr3787"&gt;Honor America's Guard-Reserve Retirees Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Military members who served in the National Guard or Reserves, but were never called up to active duty, are not considered "veterans" under federal law. Walz's bill would have granted them veteran status if they'd served at least 20 years.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"These men and women took an oath to defend our nation at any cost and have dedicated their lives in service to our country," &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120927232539/http://walz.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;task=view&amp;amp;id=366&amp;amp;Itemid=25"&gt;Walz said in a 2011 press release&lt;/a&gt;. "This is about giving them the honor and recognition they deserve."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents included the VA itself, countering that the existing definition exists for a reason.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"VA recognizes that the National Guard and Reserves have admirably served this country and in recent years have played an important role in our nation's overseas conflicts," David McLenachen, VA's Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Disability Assistance, &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150804014658/http://veterans.house.gov/witness-testimony/mr-david-r-mclenachen-1"&gt;said in House committee testimony in 2015&lt;/a&gt;. "Nevertheless, VA does not support this bill because it represents a departure from active service as the foundation for veteran status."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walz reintroduced the bill in four consecutive Congress, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr3787/cosponsors"&gt;attracting&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr1025/cosponsors"&gt;steadily&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr679/cosponsors"&gt;more&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hr1384/cosponsors"&gt;cosponsors&lt;/a&gt; each time. It passed the House three of those four times: in 2009 and 2011 by voice vote, then in 2015 unanimously by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/114-2015/h628"&gt;407-0&lt;/a&gt;. However, the Senate never took it up.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where is it today?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most National Guard or Reserves members who were never called up to active duty are still &lt;a href="https://www.va.gov/OSDBU/docs/Determining-Veteran-Status.pdf#page=3"&gt;not considered veterans&lt;/a&gt;. (Rare exemptions are granted for those who became disabled because of an injury incurred as part of their role, for example during military training.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GovTrack was &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?congress=__ALL__&amp;amp;text=%22Honor%20America%E2%80%99s%20Guard-Reserve%20Retirees%20Act%22#sort=-introduced_date&amp;amp;congress=__ALL__"&gt;unable to locate any subsequent version of the bill introduced by another member of Congress&lt;/a&gt; after Walz left.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr4617"&gt;Separate Taxpayer Dollars from the Election Process Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;2010's Supreme Court decision &lt;a href="https://tile.loc.gov/storage-services/service/ll/usrep/usrep558/usrep558310/usrep558310.pdf"&gt;Citizens United v. FEC&lt;/a&gt; allowed unlimited independent political campaign spending by corporations and unions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Overturning the decision entirely would take a constitutional amendment. Indeed, Walz cosponsored three unsuccessful constitutional amendments from &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/theodore_deutch/412385"&gt;Rep. Ted Deutch (D-FL22)&lt;/a&gt; to do just that, in &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hjres119/cosponsors"&gt;2014&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/hjres22/cosponsors"&gt;2015&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hjres31"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But Walz also introduced a smaller and more targeted proposal, which only required a bill rather than a constitutional amendment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;During the 2008 financial crash, Congress created the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP) to bail out major financial institutions. Walz's bill would have prevented those corporations specifically from spending money on campaigns or elections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"It was wrong that American taxpayers had to bail out Wall Street banks for their reckless behavior," &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100321081939/http://walz.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;amp;view=article&amp;amp;id=240:walz-introduces-bill-to-prevent-wall-street-banks-from-using-taxpayer-qbailout-dollarsq-to-influence-the-outcome-of-us-elections&amp;amp;catid=7:latest-news"&gt;Walz said in a 2010 press release&lt;/a&gt;. "It is outrageous these same Wall Street banks can now use your taxpayer money to run TV attack ads attempting to elect or defeat candidates for public office."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents counter that the Supreme Court decision protected free speech and political advocacy, a liberty at the very heart of American rights.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"While it is true that some for-profit corporations have great amounts of wealth at their disposal, most of the several million corporations in the United States lack the financial wherewithal to corrupt officeholders," &lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/Citizens-United-CU-Supplemental-Reply-Brief.pdf#page=9"&gt;the titular organization Citizens United wrote in their Supreme Court brief&lt;/a&gt;. "In that sense, corporations are reflective of America's individuals."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Where is it today?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walz's bill attracted no cosponsors and never received a vote in either the House Administration or Financial Services Committees, even though Democrats controlled the chamber at the time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;TARP &lt;a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/ally-financial-exits-tarp-as-treasury-sells-remaining-stake-1419000430"&gt;effectively ended in December 2014&lt;/a&gt;, when the federal government sold its last shares of Ally Financial, the last remaining institution covered by the program.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr2691"&gt;Wind Energy Promotion Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walz introduced a bill making it easier to qualify for federal wind energy tax credits, which could have brought more money to the clean energy industry &lt;a href="https://cleangridalliance.org/blog/80/minnesota-renewable-energy-job-growth-is-the-focus-of-new-report-and-case-study"&gt;booming in Walz's home state of Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Raising capital for wind energy projects is difficult, because many residents of rural America do not qualify for the Renewable Energy Production Tax Credit (PTC), which is one of the major incentives to promote wind energy production," &lt;a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20070613015211/http://www.walz.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=67417"&gt;Walz said in a 2007 press release&lt;/a&gt;. "This legislation will... [level] the playing field for individuals in rural America who are looking to enter the industry."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents counter that wind turbines "kill all the birds," &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/15/jd-vance-agenda-policies-00168467"&gt;Vance said at a June speech to the Turning Point Action conference&lt;/a&gt;, even though research found they kill &lt;a href="https://climate.mit.edu/ask-mit/do-wind-turbines-kill-birds"&gt;20 times fewer&lt;/a&gt; birds than fossil fuel energy.  "And they're mostly made in China," he added, though that &lt;a href="https://energydigital.com/top10/top-10-wind-turbine-manufacturers"&gt;may not be true either&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Walz introduced the bill twice. His 2007 version attracted eight bipartisan cosponsors, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/110/hr2691/cosponsors"&gt;six Democrats and two Republicans&lt;/a&gt;, but never received a House Ways and Means Committee vote. His 2009 version attracted nine bipartisan cosponsors: &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr3135/cosponsors"&gt;eight Democrats and one Republican&lt;/a&gt;, but again never received a committee vote. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, 2009's Democratic-controlled Congress enacted the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr1"&gt;American Recovery and Reinvestment Act&lt;/a&gt; -- often nicknamed "the stimulus" -- which included &lt;a href="https://www.energy.gov/recovery-act"&gt;$31 billion in renewable energy incentives and investments&lt;/a&gt;. Walz voted for that legislation, as did &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/111-2009/h70"&gt;all but seven House Democrats&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As governor, Walz has &lt;a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/06/climate/tim-walz-climate-change.html"&gt;focused on climate issues&lt;/a&gt;, declaring a state goal of 100% clean or renewable energy by 2040. He signed his most recent state energy legislation in June &lt;a href="https://mn.gov/governor/newsroom/press-releases/?id=1055-630240"&gt;at a wind farm in Dexter, Minnesota&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;hr&gt;  &lt;p&gt;    Let us know what you think about these updates    by tooting us on &lt;a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@GovTrack" title="Mastodon"&gt;&lt;i class="fab fa-mastodon"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;    or &lt;a href="https://govtrack.us/contact" style="text-decoration: none"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-envelope"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; sending us an email&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;    			&lt;/div&gt;</description>

It's a complex bill that has generated both &lt;a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/will-kosa-coppa-20-controversial-bills-explained-rcna163243"&gt;bipartisan support and opposition as summarized by NBC&lt;/a&gt;. Despite the level of controversy, it passed the Senate &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/s221"&gt;91-3&lt;/a&gt;. Yesterday, numerous reports indicated that the bill will not be brought up in the House. So, despite its big majority in the Senate, it's &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/senate/schumer-july-biden-out-democrats-hopes-in-senate/"&gt;likely dead for this Congress&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Tax Relief Bill&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Senate procedure note&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the Senate, the debate phase for a bill has no defined end. To move to a vote on the bill itself, the Senate has to agree to end debate. &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/powers-procedures/filibusters-cloture.htm"&gt;This kind of vote is called a "cloture" vote&lt;/a&gt;. It's also what people mean when they talk about the filibuster. To pass - that is, to end debate - 60 Senators have to get on board. With the Senate almost evenly split, few bills can jump this hurdle. And the one below did not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7024"&gt;H.R. 7024: Tax Relief for American Families and Workers Act of 2024&lt;/a&gt; would provide tax relief in various forms for both businesses and families. It failed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/s230"&gt;48-44&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;See you next week for a post answering one or maybe more questions we've received from you!&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;hr&gt;  &lt;p&gt;    Let us know what you think about these updates    by tooting us on &lt;a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@GovTrack" title="Mastodon"&gt;&lt;i class="fab fa-mastodon"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;    or &lt;a href="https://govtrack.us/contact" style="text-decoration: none"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-envelope"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; sending us an email&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;    			&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Ron DeSantis, and others talking about our legislator ideology rankings over the last week. For more about that, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/posts/434/2024-07-26_we-retracted-our-single-year-legislator-report-cards-after-warning-about-their-unreliability"&gt;see our post about it on our website&lt;/a&gt;. But enough about us. Here's what Congress is up to this week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;After it became apparent they could not pass their appropriations bills, the House of Representatives recessed a week early and won’t be back until September 9th. The Senate is in though and will join the House in recess later this week, also returning on the 9th. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The House gave up on passing the appropriations bills before October 1st, the start of the new fiscal year, and will instead spend the few weeks back working with the Senate on a &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/help/legislative-glossary#c"&gt;continuing resolution&lt;/a&gt;. If they fail to agree, the government will shut down, but that is unlikely to occur. The resolution likely will keep the government funded at current levels until Congress can hammer out a deal, most likely after the election. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As usual, the Senate calendar gives &lt;a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/2024/07/25/schedule-for-monday-july-29-2024"&gt;little hint&lt;/a&gt; about their floor plans beyond nominations. According to the &lt;a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/07/25/senate-tees-up-kids-online-safety-bill-for-vote-next-week/"&gt;Roll Call&lt;/a&gt;, a Capitol hill newspaper, the Senate teed up two bills for floor consideration this week: the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s1409"&gt;Kids Online Safety Act&lt;/a&gt; and the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7890"&gt;Children and Teens’ Online Privacy Protection Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senate committees have &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2024/07/29?q=%7B%22chamber%22%3A%22Senate%22%7D"&gt;22 meetings&lt;/a&gt; scheduled for this week. The most notable is a Senate Appropriations Committee meeting on Thursday where the full committee will mark-up five appropriations bills. Unless I miss my count, the expected passage of those measures would result in the Senate Appropriations Committee having favorably reported all twelve of its appropriations bills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other notable hearings address &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/senate-event/336096?s=1&amp;amp;r=5"&gt;the assassination attempt on former President Trump&lt;/a&gt;, an examination of &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/senate-event/336088?s=1&amp;amp;r=7"&gt;banning noncompete agreements&lt;/a&gt;, examining &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/senate-event/336086?s=1&amp;amp;r=8"&gt;Senate procedures to confirm nominees&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/senate-event/336094?s=2&amp;amp;r=4"&gt;future of electric vehicles&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/event/118th-congress/senate-event/336091?s=2&amp;amp;r=7"&gt;birth behind bars&lt;/a&gt;, and an array of nominations and proposed legislation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;I hope you have enjoyed these previews of the upcoming week’s legislative activities. I’m looking forward to continuing them in September.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;hr&gt;  &lt;p&gt;    Let us know what you think about these updates    by tooting us on &lt;a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@GovTrack" title="Mastodon"&gt;&lt;i class="fab fa-mastodon"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;    or &lt;a href="https://govtrack.us/contact" style="text-decoration: none"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-envelope"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; sending us an email&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;    			&lt;/div&gt;</description>

A newer ranking that we published in 2021 says she was the leftmost &lt;em&gt;Democratic&lt;/em&gt; senator. Catch the difference? Right-wing media didn't like it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;We were forthright about the limitations of the analysis in 2020&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our ideology scores rank legislators according to who they partner with to co-sponsor legislation. In 2020, &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/08/13/what-measures-ideology-tell-us-about-members-congress-what-they-dont/"&gt;The Washington Post&lt;/a&gt; wrote about our widely reported score of then-Senator Harris:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Trump’s reelection team must have been ecstatic to discover, buried in a wonky government-tracking website, a bit of data that helped it make the case it has wanted to make ... Why, according to GovTrack, [Biden's] pick to serve as running mate, Sen. Kamala D. Harris, is the most liberal member of the Senate! ... But that Harris isn’t generally seen as one of the most liberal members of the Senate suggests that it’s also potentially missing something, which GovTrack’s Josh Tauberer readily acknowledges.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;“Obviously our analysis is at odds with what other serious analysis of Harris’s career has found, and I think the short answer is that both things can be true: She can both be sponsoring/co-sponsoring left-leaning legislation, something with typically little risk, while also being pragmatic when push comes to shove on risky and impactful decisions..." he said in an email.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;And it could be politics. “Our analysis might also reflect a possible (but unsubstantiated) deliberate attempt by Harris to co-sponsor legislation to pull her record left ahead of the primaries,” he added, “or, conversely, that other senators could have been unwilling to work with Harris in order to hurt her campaign.”&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's just not possible to reduce a legislator to a perfect number. I know that some legislators even try to manipulate their own ranking on our site.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Despite my warning in The Washington Post, two months later CBS's "60 Minutes" asked Harris about our stat, and clips from the interview have been &lt;a href="https://x.com/yashar/status/1816618786575049097"&gt;a part of Donald Trump's campaigns&lt;/a&gt; ever since.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;What is the right way to quantify a legislator's political views?&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;What is the right way to quantify a legislator's political views? Should we look at what they say or how they vote? The &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nolan_Chart"&gt;two-axis liberal-conservative authoritarian-libertarian charts&lt;/a&gt; are popular, but are those the right categories? Is two dimensions enough? What fair procedure could be used to determine where a policy position (or, worse, a thousand-page bill with provisions all across the board) should fall on the chart? And how many positions should be rated: ten, a hundred, a thousand?&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Our legislator ideology scores, which we began computing in 2004, followed a different path entirely. We don't look at what legislators say or how they vote. Instead, we look at the other legislators who they co-sponsor bills with. We don't use two dimensions: We only use one. We don't rate the bills they are signing onto as conservative or liberal: We don't read the bills at all. Instead, we measure how similar legislators are to each other in what set of bills they have co-sponsored. If they co-sponsor many bills together, they will get a similar score; if they co-sponsor few bills together, their scores will be far apart. Through a miracle of math, it more-or-less works. (Our methodology is described in more detail &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/about/analysis#ideology"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and we have also posted its source code. Thanks to our advocacy work, Congress publishes the co-sponsorship data, so anyone can do the analysis.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The score can be interpreted as a left—right scale measuring the dominant ideological difference or differences among Members of Congress, although of course it only takes into account a small aspect of reality, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/report-cards/2022"&gt;as we note on the site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Are we doing it the right way? Well, we're doing it &lt;em&gt;a&lt;/em&gt; way.  The researchers who started &lt;a href="https://voteview.com/"&gt;VoteView.com&lt;/a&gt;, known in the research world as DW-NOMINATE scores, pioneered the use of math to rate legislators like this and followed a third path. Our scores are &lt;a href="https://voteview.com/person/41701/kamala-devi-harris"&gt;often similar&lt;/a&gt; to theirs but never the same. And although our procedure is fully automated, I have never called it unbiased. Our choices affect the scores. Political views are multifaceted and dynamic, giving pros and cons to any way of reducing a person's viewpoints to one or a few numbers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;It's within the margin of error&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;We do this anyway, despite the limitations, because we need simplification to understand the world. One of our foundational principles is to enable the American public to make data driven decisions based on the best information we can provide. It's a delicate balance to simplify, but not too much.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So it's not the only statistic we compute about ideology: We also report how often legislators join and author bipartisan bills. And we report our ideology scores over different time periods.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On our &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/kamala_harris/412678"&gt;main page for Harris&lt;/a&gt; and similarly for every other legislator, we currently report an ideology score computed over a six-year period (in which she served the last four years). She's 4th from the left, after Sen. Sanders, Gillibrand, and Merkley. Our &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/report-cards/2018/senate/ideology"&gt;"report card" for the 2017-2018 session of Congress&lt;/a&gt;, based on a two-year period, shows the same (with Sanders and Gillibrand reversed). For &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/report-cards/2020/senate/ideology"&gt;the 2019-2020 session&lt;/a&gt; which we published after the session completed in 2021 we have Harris 2nd, after Sanders --- which we also show as &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/report-cards/2020/party-senate-democrat"&gt;1st among the Democrats&lt;/a&gt; since Sanders is technically an Independent.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It fluctuates depending on how much data, how many years of co-sponsorship data, we feed the algorithm. With less data, the analysis is less reliable --- like a margin of error in polls. So what's the right amount of data to use? Is one year enough? In report card pages based on just a single year of data, we previously reported Harris ranked 8th (&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200401113527/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/report-cards/2017/senate/ideology"&gt;2017&lt;/a&gt;) and 1st (&lt;a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20200302081354/https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/report-cards/2019/senate/ideology"&gt;2019&lt;/a&gt;). (We only published single year statistics for odd-numbered years because in even years we published two-year statistics lined up with the congressional calendar.) The single-year 2019 statistic is what originally drew the attention of Republicans in 2020.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The jump from 8th to 1st and whether she is 1st or 2nd, it's probably all just statistical noise that doesn't reflect an underlying ground truth. Even at its most reliable, there is still a margin of error (metaphorically speaking) just from the different possible methodologies we could have used but didn't, such as using votes instead of co-sponsorship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;Standing behind our analysis&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The significant fluctuation and the attention given to a cherry-picked year gave me pause. I realized that the limited data available in a single year was not sufficient to create a reliable portrait of the activity of legislators, particularly given the ebbs and flows of the legislative calendar, and therefore it did not serve as a useful tool to our users and the American public. It's important to me that we put out information that we can stand behind. After 2020, based on this reflection, GovTrack stopped publishing new single-year statistics but continued the two- and six-year statistics.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When I saw earlier this week that &lt;a href="https://x.com/yashar/status/1815476912355205212"&gt;attention was being directed to a part of our site that I had warned was not reliable&lt;/a&gt;, we took the single-calendar-year statistics off the site for the same reason. All of them, and for all legislators.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The difference, as I noted at the top, is whether we say Harris was the leftmost senator in 2019 or the leftmost Democrat in 2019-2020. It is the smallest of hills to die on.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But a lot of blue checkmarks on Twitter didn't like it, all the way up to &lt;a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1816360430069076161"&gt;the checkmarkiest of them all&lt;/a&gt;. After that we started getting a steady stream of vile, and sometimes racist and antisemitic, emails about it. One nicer emailer asked, "Was the page wrong when you published it, or did it only become wrong now that it makes Harris look bad?" (I'm paraphrasing a bit), to which I answered, "It was wrong then --- and I said so." A lot of complaints about erasing history. (I don't see them complaining about &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/07/15/jd-vance-donald-trump-comments-00168450"&gt;Trump's VP-pick deleting his old tweets&lt;/a&gt; critical of Trump.). Many emails and tweets have asked us to restore the statistic because our methodology was correct and the information important for voters to know while at the same time letting us know that we have lost all of our credibility. Well, both can't really be true, can they. Trump himself continues to cite our analysis (both the retracted one and &lt;a href="https://x.com/ProudElephantUS/status/1816244481508712771"&gt;one we still have up&lt;/a&gt;). For them, it is all obviously about whether it's convenient, not whether it's correct.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Right-wing media ran articles with ominous headlines in passive voice like &lt;a href="https://www.foxnews.com/media/webpage-rated-kamala-harris-most-liberal-senator-2019-suddenly-disappears"&gt;"suddenly disappears"&lt;/a&gt; on Fox News. (They emailed me for comment, I answered all of their questions, and they still pass it off as some invisible hand at work. It was my hand, folks.) Other outlets ran stories without asking us for comment. Most conveniently left out our newer near-identical rankings. Sean Hannity's team wrote &lt;a href="https://hannity.com/media-room/kamalas-rebrand-govtrack-deletes-2019-scorecard-showing-harris-as-most-liberal-senator/"&gt;"Is anyone buying this?"&lt;/a&gt;. Others in the far-right media have painted this as a Soviet-style partisan censorship conspiracy. Mmmhmm.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The New York Post &lt;a href="https://nypost.com/2024/07/25/us-news/govtrack-scrubbed-its-rating-that-had-kamala-harris-as-most-liberal-senator-in-2019-after-biden-dropped-out/"&gt;covered it&lt;/a&gt; as a retraction, which was right.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;hr&gt;  &lt;p&gt;    Let us know what you think about these updates    by tooting us on &lt;a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@GovTrack" title="Mastodon"&gt;&lt;i class="fab fa-mastodon"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;    or &lt;a href="https://govtrack.us/contact" style="text-decoration: none"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-envelope"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; sending us an email&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;    			&lt;/div&gt;</description>

Basically, some Republicans thought the bills were too conservative because they contained various anti-abortion provisions and others thought they weren't conservative enough because they didn't cut spending enough. Since it only takes three members to vote no to sink the bills, both were pulled.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then they spent a good bit of time on amendments to &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8997"&gt;H.R. 8997: Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2025&lt;/a&gt; before pulling it from the floor too. Amendments that passed included:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;H.Amdt. 1099 (Ogles) to H.R. 8997: To prohibit funding for the American Climate Corps which passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h363"&gt;199-197&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;H.Amdt. 1114 (Rosendale) to H.R. 8997: To prevent funds from being used to transfer or delegate control or maintenance responsibility of the Lower Yellowstone Fish Bypass Channel to any non-Federal entity which passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h374"&gt;218-204&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;H.Amdt. 1122 (Van Drew) to H.R. 8997: To move $10,000,000 from renewable energy programs to enhance the security of existing electrical transformers from cyber threats and from physical attacks from individuals which passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h379"&gt;214-203&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;One bill did survive to break the pattern above:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8998"&gt;H.R. 8998: Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2025&lt;/a&gt; and passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h399"&gt;210-205&lt;/a&gt;. It had two successful amendments:&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;H.Amdt. 1145 (Brecheen) to H.R. 8998: To prohibit funding for any diversity, equity, and inclusion program or office which passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h388"&gt;211-202&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;H.Amdt. 1170 (Perry) to H.R. 8998: To prohibit funds made available by this Act to be used for environmental justice activities which passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h397"&gt;210-204&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bills on Suspension&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hres1367"&gt;H.Res. 1367: Establishing the Task Force on the Attempted Assassination of Donald J. Trump&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h393"&gt;416-0&lt;/a&gt;. Membership is still being determined.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s3706"&gt;S. 3706: Victims’ VOICES Act&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h361"&gt;408-2&lt;/a&gt;. This bill would allow someone acting on behalf of a victim of crime to receive restitution. The only no votes were from two Republicans. It goes to the President next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s227"&gt;S. 227: Improving Access to Our Courts Act&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h362"&gt;404-3&lt;/a&gt;. The only no votes were three Republicans who voted against adding two new physical locations in which court must be held in Texas and Washington districts. It goes to the President next.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8812/summary"&gt;H.R. 8812: Water Resources Development Act of 2024&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h358"&gt;359-13&lt;/a&gt;. This bill "authorizes, deauthorizes, and modifies various water resources feasibility studies and projects of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Here's the other break in the pattern: two bills on suspension failed:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr1631"&gt;H.R. 1631: Pro Codes Act&lt;/a&gt; failed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h357"&gt;248-127&lt;/a&gt;. This bill would give private entities that produce codes referenced in laws - like building codes - copyright protection provided those entities make the codes freely available online. However, the burden of pursuing those entities if they did not put the codes on the web for free would fall to others. This vote was unusual in another way: there wasn't an immediately obvious pattern to who voted yes or no and a large number of members (56) didn't vote at all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7887/summary"&gt;H.R. 7887: ACCESS Act&lt;/a&gt; failed on suspension by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h380"&gt;178-234&lt;/a&gt;. It would have failed on a regular vote too with all Democrats voting against along with 35 Republicans. The bill would have prohibited requirements for minimum experience or education in federal solicitations unless the agency specifically explained why such minimums were required.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Nominations&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/s214"&gt;Colleen Duffy Kiko, of North Dakota, to be a Member of the Federal Labor Relations Authority for a term of five years expiring July 29, 2027&lt;/a&gt; passed the Senate 82-6&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Partisan Messaging&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;As its last act before leaving for six weeks, the House voted on&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hres1371"&gt;H.Res. 1371: Strongly condemning the Biden Administration and its Border Czar, Kamala Harris’s, failure to secure the United States border&lt;/a&gt;. It passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h400"&gt;220-196&lt;/a&gt; with six Democrats voting in favor. Those Democrats are all in otherwise right-leaning districts and they have consistently been voting in favor of Republican bills regarding border issues all year long.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The title is incorrect - &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2021/03/24/remarks-by-president-biden-and-vice-president-harris-in-a-meeting-on-immigration/"&gt;Harris was given responsibility 2021 for diplomacy with nations from which many folks arriving at the border come&lt;/a&gt; in order to try to make staying in their home countries more attractive and viable. Responsibility for managing the US borders belongs to the &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/topics/secretary-homeland-security"&gt;Department of Homeland Security&lt;/a&gt;. The text of the resolution, which has no legal force, was amended to accurately describe Harris's responsibilities and (largely) Republican dissatisfaction with how the Biden Administration has managed migrants arriving at the border.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Scheduling note&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;With Congress out until September 9th, we'll be using the interim to address more of the questions we've received and, as always, feel free to let us know if you've got one burning you'd like answered.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;hr&gt;  &lt;p&gt;    Let us know what you think about these updates    by tooting us on &lt;a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@GovTrack" title="Mastodon"&gt;&lt;i class="fab fa-mastodon"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;    or &lt;a href="https://govtrack.us/contact" style="text-decoration: none"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-envelope"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; sending us an email&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;    			&lt;/div&gt;</description>

The House of Representatives and Senate are in session for the next two weeks. After that, they are off for the August recess, returning on September 9. During that gap, members of Congress who wish to be re-elected will focus on their campaigns and Democrats will hold their national convention. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This Wednesday, the chambers will hold a rare joint session of Congress to hear an address from Israel’s Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, at approximately 2pm. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The House of Representatives&lt;/strong&gt; this week has &lt;a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/schedule/weekly-schedule.htm"&gt;three measures set for consideration&lt;/a&gt; on the House floor that are subject to a rule, which means the Rules Committee will limit debate and the legislation can pass with a simple majority of members present. Two bills concern appropriations, specifically &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8998"&gt;Interior&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8997"&gt;Energy &amp;amp; Water&lt;/a&gt;. The third &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20240722/Task%20Force%20Res%20-%20Kelly%20PA.pdf"&gt;measure&lt;/a&gt; would establish a task force on the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are twenty bills set for floor consideration under suspension of the rules, which means they can be enacted only with 2/3s support of the members present. Six relate to naming facilities after people. Many bills have comparatively little impact, such as &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s1973"&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; requiring the federal government to only purchase American flags made in America (with some exceptions). The &lt;a href="https://docs.house.gov/billsthisweek/20240722/HR%201631%20-%20Issa.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Protecting and Enhancing Public Access to Codes Act&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; would require that privately developed technical standards (like fire safety or building codes) incorporated into law should be available to the public. The &lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R47656/2"&gt;Congressional Research Service&lt;/a&gt; explains the background issues.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House Committees&lt;/strong&gt; are holding &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2024/07/22?q=%7B%22chamber%22%3A%22House%22%7D"&gt;forty meetings&lt;/a&gt;, including a &lt;a href="https://rules.house.gov/news/announcement/meeting-announcement-july-22-2024"&gt;Rules Committee meeting&lt;/a&gt; on Monday to consider rules that would limit debate and amendments on four appropriations bills, two set for consideration this week and two anticipated to be considered on the House floor next week. If you follow the links on the Rules Committee page, you can see the amendments the committee will be considering.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Natural Resources Committee has five hearings scheduled as does the Oversight Committee; four are scheduled before Energy &amp;amp; Commerce. Of the forty meetings, two committee hearings will focus on the attempted assassination of Donald Trump. The House Administration Committee will look at Congress in the wake of the Supreme Court’s recent &lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-chevron-curtailing-power-of-federal-agencies/"&gt;Chevron ruling&lt;/a&gt;, and the Oversight Committee will look at the Department of Justice. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Senate floor calendar&lt;/strong&gt; continues to be mysterious, with their preview for Tuesday focusing only on approving &lt;a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/2024/07/11/schedule-for-thursday-july-11-2024"&gt;various nominations&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Senate Committees&lt;/strong&gt; have &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2024/07/22?q=%7B%22chamber%22%3A%22Senate%22%7D"&gt;nine meetings&lt;/a&gt; set for this week. Appropriators will &lt;a href="https://www.senate.gov/about/research-tools/glossary.htm#M"&gt;mark-up&lt;/a&gt; legislation for Thursday, with four appropriations bills scheduled for consideration. This is a big deal, as Senate appropriators have been favorably reporting their bills unanimously, which gives them significant leverage when negotiating with the House.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;On Wednesday, the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee gave notice it is &lt;a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024-07-24-BUSINESS-MEETING.pdf"&gt;marking up&lt;/a&gt; a wide array of legislation including legislation concerning members trading stocks, S. 1171, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s1171"&gt;Ending Trading and Holdings in Congressional Stocks (ETHICS) Act&lt;/a&gt;. Also important is their consideration of S. 4373, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s4373"&gt;Reforming Emergency Powers to Uphold the Balances and Limitations Inherent in the Constitution (REPUBLIC) Act&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;hr&gt;  &lt;p&gt;    Let us know what you think about these updates    by tooting us on &lt;a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@GovTrack" title="Mastodon"&gt;&lt;i class="fab fa-mastodon"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;    or &lt;a href="https://govtrack.us/contact" style="text-decoration: none"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-envelope"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; sending us an email&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;    			&lt;/div&gt;</description>

J.D. Vance (R-OH)&lt;/a&gt; has served as &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/browse?sponsor=456876"&gt;lead sponsor for 36 bills&lt;/a&gt; during the year and a half of his freshman session of Congress so far. GovTrack looked through all his bills and found 8 of the most interesting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;He's joined Democrats in cosponsoring bills to &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2233"&gt;ban sales of products with lethal levels of sodium nitrite&lt;/a&gt;, an increasingly common method of suicide, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s1790"&gt;claw back bank executives' compensation when banks go under&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s576"&gt;increasing fines on railroad companies&lt;/a&gt; (more on that one below).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, the legislation he has introduced himself largely touches on hot-button social issues including immigration, affirmative action and race, transgender issues, and trade with China. He has also proposed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s3514"&gt;increasing taxes on major universities&lt;/a&gt; and having &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2403"&gt;the federal government backstop community and small regional banks&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Just one of his 36 bills has received a committee vote in Congress, with none yet enacted into law, which is expected for his short tenure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Regardless, they reveal how Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's running mate could help govern from the White House.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s4045"&gt;East Palestine Health Impact Monitoring Act&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s576"&gt;Railway Safety Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;The East Palestine Health Impact Monitoring Act would commission a study on the health impacts of February 2023's Norfolk Southern train derailment and toxic chemical spill in East Palestine, Ohio.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's Vance's only bill that has had any action so far, passed by committee 19-2 earlier this year &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Y1QoqGwqvCA?si=CZSJvzKaAQ3WyQQQ&amp;amp;t=2973"&gt;despite opposition only from Republicans&lt;/a&gt;: Sens. &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/mike_braun/412839"&gt;Mike Braun (R-IN)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/rand_paul/412492"&gt;Rand Paul (R-KY)&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The 102-page Railway Safety Act, introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/sherrod_brown/400050"&gt;Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-OH)&lt;/a&gt; with Vance as an original cosponsor, would change a number of railroad regulations in response to the train derailment.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The new rules would include increased fines on railroads, so much so that the Congressional Budget Office says the bill &lt;a href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2024-02/s576.pdf"&gt;would lower the deficit&lt;/a&gt;. Another requirement would mandate that all trains operate with at least two-person crews.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We owe every American the peace of mind that their community is protected from a catastrophe of this kind," &lt;a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senators-vance-brown-to-introduce-bipartisan-legislation-to-prevent-train-derailment-disasters/"&gt;Sen. Vance said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;.  "One day, the TV cameras will leave and the news cycle will move on, but the needs of those Ohioans will remain."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Railroad industry opponents counter that many components of the bill are solutions in search of a problem. We oppose "provisions including those that mandate crew staffing models, expand hazmat transportation operating requirements, micromanage detector networks, and unnecessarily broaden manual inspections," &lt;a href="https://www.aar.org/news/aar-statement-on-senate-commerce-rail-safety-act-vote/"&gt;the Association of American Railroads (AAR) wrote in a statement&lt;/a&gt;. "In . . . safety legislation, each provision should be clearly designed to rectify a current safety challenge. As reported out of the committee, this bill falls short of that goal."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs Committee approved the bill in May 2023 &lt;a href="https://www.commerce.senate.gov/2023/5/bipartisan-railway-safety-act-heads-to-senate-floor"&gt;by a 16-11 vote&lt;/a&gt; with most Republicans opposing. It has yet to receive a vote in the full chamber.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;However, some of its provisions have taken effect through other means. In April 2024, the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) &lt;a href="https://www.transportation.gov/briefing-room/biden-harris-administration-announces-final-rule-train-crew-size-safety-requirements"&gt;mandated minimum two-person crews for freight rail&lt;/a&gt;. In May, Norfolk Southern &lt;a href="https://rollcall.com/2024/05/23/norfolk-southern-agrees-to-1b-in-settlements-for-east-palestine/"&gt;agreed to pay approximately $1 billion to settle lawsuits&lt;/a&gt; brought by a combination of the Justice Department and private citizens.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s1109"&gt;English Language Unity Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;While English is by far the most commonly spoken and written language in the U.S., &lt;a href="https://www.usa.gov/official-language-of-us#:%7E:text=Does%20the%20U.S.%20have%20an,it%20as%20their%20official%20language."&gt;there's no official national language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Many individual states declare English as the official language, though. Not just red states; blue state examples include &lt;a href="https://repository.uclawsf.edu/ca_ballot_props/968/"&gt;California&lt;/a&gt;. Vance's home state of Ohio &lt;a href="https://proenglish.org/ohio/"&gt;doesn't appear to have an official language&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill would make English the official national language, a symbolic change, and would require that official functions like laws and proceedings be in English in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. (All laws and virtually all proceedings already are in English there, of course, and Vance's bill does not include Puerto Rico where the government operates primarily in Spanish.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It would also &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s1109/text/is#link=3_a_%7EQ1_6_164_a&amp;amp;nearest=H2436BDEF34324CB2B22EF304D243B74E"&gt;require English proficiency to become a U.S. citizen&lt;/a&gt; -- even though that's &lt;a href="https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-12-part-e-chapter-2#:%7E:text=A.%20Educational%20Requirements&amp;amp;text=The%20naturalization%20test%20consists%20of,determined%20by%20a%20civics%20test"&gt;already required&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"This commonsense legislation recognizes an inherent truth: English is the language of this country," &lt;a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-to-introduce-legislation-to-establish-english-as-the-official-language-of-the-united-states/"&gt;Sen. Vance said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. "The English language has been a cornerstone of American culture for over 250 years. It is far past time for Congress to codify its place into law."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The United States’s “melting pot” metaphor doesn’t come from nowhere, however. Native Americans, many colonial settlers, people brought into the country as slaves, people in Spanish territories acquired by the United States in the 1800s, and immigrants throughout that time all have spoken languages other than English.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents counter that such a law sends the wrong message in a country where &lt;a href="https://www.census.gov/library/stories/2022/12/languages-we-speak-in-united-states.html"&gt;67.8 million Americans now speak a language other than English at home&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;President Barack Obama, answering a question on the subject at a Georgia voter forum back in 2008, &lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/us/politics/11checkpoint.html"&gt;said&lt;/a&gt;: "I agree that immigrants should learn English" but argued that an actual law was unnecessary.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Instead of worrying about whether immigrants can learn English — they'll learn English — you need to make sure your child can speak Spanish," Obama said. "You should be thinking about how can your child become bilingual. We should have every child speaking more than one language."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill has attracted &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s1109/cosponsors"&gt;two Republican cosponsors&lt;/a&gt;, Sens. &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/kevin_cramer/412555"&gt;Kevin Cramer (R-ND)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/roger_marshall/412704"&gt;Roger Marshall (R-KS)&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr997"&gt;House version&lt;/a&gt; introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/robert_good/456853"&gt;Rep. Bob Good (R-VA5)&lt;/a&gt; has attracted &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr997/cosponsors"&gt;17 Republican cosponsors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s4516"&gt;Dismantle DEI Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;DEI ("Diversity Equity and Inclusion")  refers to initiatives to increase representation of historically under-represented and marginalized demographic groups at institutions such as workplaces and in education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill would discontinue all DEI programs across the federal government, plus for private companies that contract with the federal government.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The DEI agenda is a destructive ideology that breeds hatred and racial division. It has no place in our federal government or anywhere else in our society," &lt;a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-rep-cloud-introduce-legislation-to-eliminate-all-dei-programs-from-the-federal-government/"&gt;Sen. Vance said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. "Americans' tax dollars should not be co-opted to spread this radical and divisive ideology -- this bill would ensure they are not."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents counter that the federal government has a responsibility to remedy past discrimination and prejudices. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Because advancing equity requires a systematic approach to embedding fairness in decision-making processes, executive departments and agencies must recognize and work to redress inequities in their policies and programs that serve as barriers to equal opportunity," &lt;a href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/presidential-actions/2021/01/20/executive-order-advancing-racial-equity-and-support-for-underserved-communities-through-the-federal-government/"&gt;President Joe Biden wrote in a 2021 executive order on his first day in office&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill has attracted &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s4516/cosponsors"&gt;13 Republican cosponsors&lt;/a&gt;. The &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8706"&gt;House version&lt;/a&gt; introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/michael_cloud/412746"&gt;Rep. Michael Cloud (R-TX27)&lt;/a&gt; has attracted &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8706/cosponsors"&gt;61 Republican cosponsors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2357"&gt;Protect Children's Innocence Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Gender-affirming" surgeries, such as breast removal or genital reconstruction, have been performed much more in recent years, with about &lt;a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2808707"&gt;1,000 surgeries performed nationwide per year on patients aged 18 or younger&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Republican policies have zeroed in on minors: &lt;a href="https://www.kff.org/other/dashboard/gender-affirming-care-policy-tracker/"&gt;25 states&lt;/a&gt; have either banned or significantly restricted transgender medical care for minors, including surgeries, hormone treatments, and puberty blockers. All 25 similar state laws were enacted just since 2021, when Arkansas became the first.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's home state of Ohio is among them. In 2023, Gov. Mike DeWine (R) broke with his own party by &lt;a href="https://apnews.com/article/transgender-health-ohio-minors-veto-c615cafed4fc81d32010d47d8853efaf"&gt;vetoing the Enact Ohio Saving Adolescents From Experimentation (SAFE) Act, &lt;/a&gt;which would have banned transgender medical care for minors. But in January 2024, the legislature overrode the veto: &lt;a href="https://www.legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/hb68/votes"&gt;65-28 in the state House and 24-8 in the state Senate&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill would ban "gender-affirming" medical care for transgender minors nationwide.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The practice would still be permitted for adults. While some states have placed restrictions, no state has outright banned gender-affirming medical care for transgender adults -- though individual &lt;a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/03/29/transgender-health-care-adult-ban-bills"&gt;state legislators in Kansas, Oklahoma, South Carolina, and Texas&lt;/a&gt; have introduced bills to do so.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Under no circumstances should doctors be allowed to perform these gruesome, irreversible operations on underage children," &lt;a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-introduces-legislation-to-ban-gender-reassignment-procedures-on-minors/"&gt;Sen. Vance said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. "With this legislation, we have an opportunity to save countless young Americans from a lifetime of suffering and regret."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;But studies show &lt;a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/what-the-science-on-gender-affirming-care-for-transgender-kids-really-shows/"&gt;Vance's dire claims aren't actually true&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents of the bill include some conservatives -- including the aforementioned Gov. DeWine, who defended his veto as consistent with pro-life positions on other issues like abortion.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Ultimately, I believe this is about protecting human life. Many parents have told me that their child would be dead today if they had not received the treatment they received from an Ohio children's hospital," &lt;a href="https://content.govdelivery.com/attachments/OHIOGOVERNOR/2023/12/29/file_attachments/2731770/Signed%20Veto%20Message%20HB%2068.pdf"&gt;Gov. DeWine wrote in his veto message&lt;/a&gt;. "I have also been told, by those that are now grown adults, that but for this care, they would have taken their lives when they were teenagers."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill has attracted &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2357/cosponsors"&gt;two Republican cosponsors&lt;/a&gt;, Sens. &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/mike_braun/412839"&gt;Mike Braun (R-IN)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/tommy_tuberville/456796"&gt;Tommy Tuberville (R-AL)&lt;/a&gt;.  The &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr5636"&gt;House version&lt;/a&gt; introduced by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/marjorie_greene/456814"&gt;Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA14)&lt;/a&gt; has attracted &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr5636"&gt;47 Republican cosponsors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2656"&gt;Timely Departure Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;In fiscal year 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/publication/entryexit-overstay-report"&gt;the most recent data available&lt;/a&gt;, 853,955 foreign travelers overstayed their temporary U.S. visas, or &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/sites/default/files/2023-07/23_0707_FY22_FY23_CBP_Integrated_Entry_Exit_Overstay_Report.pdf#page=6"&gt;3.7% of travelers whose visas expired that year&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill would create a new bond system, requiring visa holders to deposit between $5,000 and $15,000 upon entering the U.S., which they'd receive back from the government if they leave by their visa's listed deadline.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"America is a welcoming nation, but we are also a nation of laws," &lt;a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-introduces-legislation-to-crack-down-on-illegal-visa-overstays/"&gt;Sen. Vance said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. "There are millions of people in this country who have abused our visa system and circumvented our legal immigration process. It is a slap in the face to the working-class Ohioans whose wages are suffering."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents counter that the policy would limit U.S. visits primarily to the rich.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The fact that people would get their money back at departure doesn't address the issue that most people around the world don't have access to big sums of cash or to substantial credit," &lt;a href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-immigration-visa-overstay-rcna96973"&gt;columnist Zeeshan Aleem wrote for MSNBC&lt;/a&gt;. "The U.S. would become an impossible travel destination for many and an undesirable travel destination for others."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill has &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2656/details"&gt;not yet attracted any cosponsors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s3516"&gt;WIRED (Withholding Illegal Revenue Entering Drug Markets) Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;When an immigrant -- whether documented or undocumented -- sends money to their families or friends back in their home country, that's called a "remittance."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Republicans are concerned that some remittances help fund gang activity, violence, and cartels, particularly in nations like Mexico. In 2022, U.S. remittances comprised &lt;a href="https://www.dallasfed.org/research/swe/2023/swe2310"&gt;4.5% of Mexico's economy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://oklahoma.gov/content/dam/ok/en/tax/documents/resources/rules-and-policies/agency-rules/Chapter95-2022.pdf#page=29"&gt;Since 2010&lt;/a&gt;, Oklahoma has been the &lt;a href="https://americafirstpolicy.com/issues/state-legislative-priority-international-wire-transfer-fees2"&gt;only&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;a href="https://cis.org/North/Heres-Research-Idea-Support-State-Taxes-Remittances"&gt;state&lt;/a&gt; to impose a fee on such transactions, set at 1%. Vance's bill would set a considerably larger federal 10% fee on international remittances.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"We cannot stand idly by as illegal immigrants and drug cartels profit from breaking our nation's laws," &lt;a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-rep-hern-introduce-bill-to-tax-international-money-transfers-by-cartels-and-illegal-immigrants/"&gt;Sen. Vance said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. "This legislation is a commonsense solution to disincentivize illegal immigration and reduce the cartels' financial power."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents counter that the bill would primarily hurt innocent low-income people who want to help their family back home.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Probably 99 percent of the people that send money back to Mexico and other countries, they send it back to feed their families," David Castillo, executive director of the Greater Oklahoma City Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, &lt;a href="https://journalrecord.com/2009/07/officials-defend-wire-transfer-fee-for-funding-drugenforcement-activities/"&gt;told Oklahoma's Journal Record in 2009 when the state law was enacted&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill has &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s3516/details"&gt;not yet attracted any cosponsors&lt;/a&gt;. The House version has also &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr6817/details"&gt;not yet attracted any cosponsors&lt;/a&gt; and hasn't received a vote in any of its five committees either.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2962"&gt;Drive American Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;As the climate crisis intensifies, congressional Democrats in 2021-22 enacted federal tax credits for customers who buy zero-emission or "plug-in" electric vehicles, &lt;a href="https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/409#:%7E:text=See%20the%20IRS%20Plug%2DIn,or%20placed%2Din%2Dservice."&gt;worth up to $7,500 per vehicle&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Republicans criticized the Biden administration's Energy Department for &lt;a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2024/05/03/biden-ev-tax-credit-rules-automakers-china-00155917"&gt;granting a reprieve on some of the law's ostensible "buy American" provisions&lt;/a&gt;. The Energy Department justified the move by noting that current production resources make it almost impossible to build such vehicles without Chinese minerals, at least for now.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill would repeal all federal electric vehicle subsidies or tax credits, replacing them with a new tax credit providing an identical maximum amount -- up to $7,500 -- for a vehicle using gas or diesel fuel and built entirely in the U.S., if such a vehicle exists.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Right now, the official policy of the Biden administration is to spend billions of dollars on subsidies for electric vehicles made overseas," &lt;a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-unveils-legislation-to-eliminate-biden-ev-credits-promote-domestic-auto-manufacturing/"&gt;Sen. Vance said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. "If we're subsidizing anything, it ought to be Ohio workers -- not the green energy daydreams that are offshoring their jobs to China."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents counter that the current tax credits help both the environment and the domestic economy.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"Making the switch to electric vehicles saves consumers money, improves our air quality, and advances our climate goals," &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/thomas_carper/300019"&gt;Sen. Tom Carper (D-DE)&lt;/a&gt;, Chair of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, &lt;a href="https://www.epw.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/2023/3/carper-statement-on-treasury-ev-tax-credit-guidance"&gt;said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. "[Tax credits] will also encourage greater investment from American companies to make these vehicles here at home — critical to ensuring that the United States leads the world into the clean energy future."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill has &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2962/details"&gt;not yet attracted any cosponsors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s3396"&gt;College Admissions Accountability Act&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;In June 2023, the Supreme Court struck down college affirmative action policies, which give preferential treatment to some applicants based on their race, in the decision &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf"&gt;Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard&lt;/a&gt;. The ruling was 6-2, with the conservative justices in favor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill would create a new "Office of the Special Inspector General for Unlawful Discrimination in Higher Education," housed within the Department of Education.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"For decades, America's higher education cartel has discriminated against applicants and students by adhering to racial preferences under the banner of 'equity,'" &lt;a href="https://www.vance.senate.gov/press-releases/senator-vance-introduces-legislation-to-crack-down-on-unlawful-discrimination-in-higher-education/"&gt;Sen. Vance said in a press release&lt;/a&gt;. "The Supreme Court's landmark decision... rightly called for an end to these unjust practices. This bill creates the means necessary to enforce the Court's decision."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Opponents counter that the Supreme Court decision was wrongly decided in the first place.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;"The Court cements a superficial rule of colorblindness as a constitutional principle in an endemically segregated society where race has always mattered and continues to matter," &lt;a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/20-1199_hgdj.pdf#page=141"&gt;Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent&lt;/a&gt;. "The Court subverts the constitutional guarantee of equal protection by further entrenching racial inequality in education, the very foundation of our democratic government and pluralistic society."&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Vance's bill has attracted &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s3396/cosponsors"&gt;five Republican cosponsors&lt;/a&gt;.

You&amp;rsquo;ll be able to choose posts from these categories:&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;Legislative Preview &amp;nbsp; &amp;ndash; &amp;nbsp; Legislative Recap &amp;nbsp; &amp;ndash; &amp;nbsp; Analysis and Commentary &amp;nbsp; &amp;ndash; &amp;nbsp; News About GovTrack &amp;nbsp; &amp;ndash; &amp;nbsp; Using GovTrack Tips&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://govtrack.us/accounts/lists" class="btn btn-primary"&gt;Sign Up &amp;raquo;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;         &lt;/div&gt;     &lt;/div&gt;      &lt;div class="col-md"&gt;        &lt;p&gt;           Jul 12, 2024           &amp;middot; by Amy West       &lt;/p&gt;        &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Update/Correction 7/13/2024: we mis-stated slightly the situation in North Dakota. We've revised that paragraph to indicate that the REAL ID process confirms citizenship for those who have it at the point of getting a state ID, but does not preclude a non-citizen from attempting to vote anyway. Despite this, there are no recorded instances in the Heritage database of that happening in ND.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;hr&gt; &lt;p&gt;You'd never know it from the news coverage this week, but Congress actually did some legislating this week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Environmental Protection / Management&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr897"&gt;H.R. 897: Alabama Underwater Forest National Marine Sanctuary and Protection Act&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h336"&gt;349-19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr5441"&gt;H.R. 5441: Long Island Sound Restoration and Stewardship Reauthorization Act of 2023&lt;/a&gt; passed by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h337"&gt;333-51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Messaging on Major Appliances&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7637"&gt;H.R. 7637: Refrigerator Freedom Act&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h341"&gt;212-192&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7700"&gt;H.R. 7700: Stop Unaffordable Dishwasher Standards Act&lt;/a&gt; passed by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h343"&gt;214-192&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both bills say they will prevent energy efficiency standards that are too costly or technologically infeasible even though there is no indication that any such regulations exist or are planned.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Election "Security"&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8281/summary"&gt;H.R. 8281: Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act&lt;/a&gt; passed by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h345"&gt;221-198&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;This bill would do two primary things: first, it would require proof of citizenship when registering to vote and second, it would make it easier for private citizens to sue election officials.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's already law that a voter must be a citizen and 18 and over to vote. What kind of proof the prospective voter must provide when registering varies by state. North Dakota does not do voter registration at all. But, in general, because of the REAL ID system for getting driving licenses now in use nationwide, in &lt;a href="https://www.usvotefoundation.org/am-i-registered-to-vote-backgrounder"&gt;states where you can simultaneously register to vote&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.dhs.gov/real-id/real-id-faqs"&gt;license applicants already &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; provide proof of citizenship&lt;/a&gt; in the form of birth certificates, passports, proof of naturalization, etc in order to get a license. Is it possible that someone might get registered inappropriately? Yes. But as we'll note below, it's incredibly rare.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Both the Heritage Foundation (conservative; the folks behind &lt;a href="https://www.project2025.org/"&gt;Project 2025&lt;/a&gt;) and the Brennan Center for Justice (liberal) have studied non-citizen voting. &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search?combine=citizenship&amp;amp;state=All&amp;amp;year=&amp;amp;case_type=All&amp;amp;fraud_type=All&amp;amp;page=0"&gt;Heritage&lt;/a&gt; found 24 instances between 2003-2023 and &lt;a href="https://www.brennancenter.org/our-work/research-reports/noncitizen-voting-missing-millions"&gt;Brennan&lt;/a&gt; found 30 incidents across 42 jurisdictions and 23.5 million votes cast in 2016. As the Bipartisan Policy Center notes, &lt;a href="https://bipartisanpolicy.org/blog/four-things-to-know-about-noncitizen-voting/"&gt;this is simply not a significant problem with the U. S. election system&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This bill will not become law this Congress, but it could come back next year and potentially succeed depending on the outcome of the election.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Also: North Dakota &lt;a href="https://www.dot.nd.gov/driver/real-id-information"&gt;requires proof of citizenship or residency to get a state ID&lt;/a&gt; which is one of the things voters must present at the polls. So even in a state without voter registration, citizenship for voters that have it is still confirmed before voting. It's possible someone could just try to vote anyway as a non-citizen, but the &lt;a href="https://www.heritage.org/voterfraud/search?state=ND"&gt;Heritage database&lt;/a&gt; shows a total of three records from 1982-present and none for a non-citizen attempting to vote.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Appropriations&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8772"&gt;H.R. 8772: Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2025&lt;/a&gt; failed by &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h352"&gt;205-213&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;It's not entirely clear why the 10 Republicans who voted against it did so since this would be the most conservative version of the appropriations they'd see. &lt;a href="https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/house/3078148/house-gop-fails-pass-bill-funding-legislative-branch/"&gt;Rep. Rosendale though said it wasn't enough&lt;/a&gt; to the Washington Examiner.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Congressional Disapproval of Nondiscrimination&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hjres165"&gt;H.J.Res. 165: Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Department of Education relating to “Nondiscrimination on the Basis of Sex in Education Programs or Activities Receiving Federal Financial Assistance”&lt;/a&gt; passed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h354"&gt;210-205&lt;/a&gt; on a party line vote.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Veto Override (failed like almost all override attempts)&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hjres109"&gt;H.J.Res. 109: Providing for congressional disapproval under chapter 8 of title 5, United States Code, of the rule submitted by the Securities and Exchange Commission relating to “Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 121”&lt;/a&gt; failed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h355"&gt;228-184&lt;/a&gt; because veto overrides require a 2/3rd majority to pass.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;The regulation at issue is very complicated and relates to transparency of crypto holdings by financial entites, but &lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/IN/IN12358"&gt;the Congressional Research Service is here to explain&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Inherent Contempt&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hres1344"&gt;H.Res. 1344: Finding that Merrick Garland, Attorney General of the United States, is in contempt of the House of Representatives for disobeying a certain subpoena&lt;/a&gt; failed &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/118-2024/h353"&gt;204-210&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Four Republicans did vote against it, but more consequential were the 12 who didn't cast a vote at all. It may come back for another round of voting.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Scheduling note&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next week is the Republican Nominating Convention and both chambers are out all week. We'll do another mailbag on Wednesday, so if there's something you'd really like us to cover in it, let us know.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;hr&gt;  &lt;p&gt;    Let us know what you think about these updates    by tooting us on &lt;a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@GovTrack" title="Mastodon"&gt;&lt;i class="fab fa-mastodon"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;    or &lt;a href="https://govtrack.us/contact" style="text-decoration: none"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-envelope"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; sending us an email&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;    			&lt;/div&gt;</description>

After that, it’s August recess and Congress won’t return until September 9th.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Joe Biden’s future&lt;/strong&gt; is the major focus in both chambers, with Democrats holding a series of meetings on and off Capitol Hill as they ponder whether to publicly or privately encourage him to step aside as the party’s nominee for president. In addition, Congress is still reacting to a series of Supreme Court decisions that &lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/06/supreme-court-strikes-down-chevron-curtailing-power-of-federal-agencies/"&gt;move discretionary regulatory power from federal agencies&lt;/a&gt; to federal courts and that &lt;a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2024/07/justices-rule-trump-has-some-immunity-from-prosecution/"&gt;grant immunity&lt;/a&gt; to presidents for illegal activities carried out while in office that qualify in some as yet undefined way as official acts.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The House of Representatives&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;a href="https://www.majorityleader.gov/schedule/weekly-schedule.htm"&gt;will consider&lt;/a&gt; six bills according to a rule (which requires a majority vote) and six bills under suspension of the rules (which requires a 2/3s vote for passage). Suspension of the rules is used both when bills are relatively noncontroversial but also when it may cause a split in the opposing party over a particular measure.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the bills subject to a rule is a bill &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8772"&gt;to appropriate funding for the Legislative branch&lt;/a&gt;, a bill &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr8281/summary"&gt;requiring citizens to show proof of citizenship in order to register to vote and that allows individuals to sue election officials&lt;/a&gt;, and a joint resolution that would &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hjres165"&gt;nullify an agency rule relating to a prohibition on discrimination on the basis of sex&lt;/a&gt; in federally funded education programs or activities. There’s also a bill &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7637"&gt;preventing the Department of Energy from enforcing energy conservation standards for refrigerators&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Among the bills under suspension is a bill to &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr6062"&gt;allow American Samoa to approve amendments to their territorial constitution&lt;/a&gt;, a bill to &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr5770"&gt;reauthorize the US Geological Survey’s authority to track water in streams and rivers&lt;/a&gt;, a bill to address &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr7377"&gt;royalties for oil and gas leaseholders&lt;/a&gt;, and a bill to &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/hr5443"&gt;relax requirements for the Department of the Interior in appraising and valuing real property&lt;/a&gt; for transactions over which Interior has jurisdiction.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;House committees&lt;/strong&gt; will hold &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2024/07/08?q=%7B%22chamber%22%3A%22House%22%7D"&gt;twenty-six proceedings&lt;/a&gt;, including a meeting by the House Rules Committee on Monday to report rules that govern consideration and possible amendments to the six bills set for consideration pursuant to a rule. Of particular note is that House Appropriators on Tuesday will consider three major appropriations bills at one markup, and another three on Wednesday — passage of which will place all six bills on a path to floor consideration next week.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Senate’s&lt;/strong&gt; floor calendar this week is a mystery, and all we know for sure are that &lt;a href="https://www.democrats.senate.gov/2024/06/20/schedule-for-pro-forma-sessions-and-monday-july-8-2024"&gt;nominations&lt;/a&gt; are on the docket. News reports suggest that Sen. Schumer is deciding between &lt;a href="https://punchbowl.news/article/senate/chuck-schumer-senate-summer/"&gt;two paths&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;One path is a series of show-votes intended to help Democratic incumbents, such as the Wyden-Smith tax bill (which includes an extension of the child tax credit) and a railway safety bill. These measures, which are popular in Ohio and thus relevant to an incumbent senator, are expected to draw Republican opposition and become stuck in the Senate, and this will draw a contrast between the parties. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The other path is a series of bills that would pass the Senate with more than sixty votes, such as the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s1409"&gt;Kids Online Safety Act&lt;/a&gt;, which has 70 co-sponsors and would require some internet platforms to identify everyone who uses their sites in an effort to mitigate harms from their use by children, and the &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/118/s2190"&gt;RECOUP Act&lt;/a&gt;, which allows the government to clawback bonuses received by bank executives in the 24 months prior to a bank failure. While these bills are bipartisan, it is expected that Senate Republicans will slow down the legislation to waste more than a week of time on the Senate floor, preventing Senate Democrats from passing other bills.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Senate committees will hold &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/committee-schedule/weekly/2024/07/08?q=%7B%22chamber%22%3A%22Senate%22%7D"&gt;26 proceedings&lt;/a&gt;, The full Senate Appropriations Committee is &lt;a href="https://www.appropriations.senate.gov/hearings/full-committee-markup-of-the-milcon-va-agriculture-fda-and-legislative-branch-appropriations-acts-and-fiscal-year-2025-subcommittee-allocations"&gt;holding a mark-up on three appropriations bills on Thursday&lt;/a&gt; as well as adopting top line spending levels for each of its appropriations subcommittees. These top lines, which will also be voted upon in the House this week, determine how appropriated funds are divided among the twelve appropriations bills. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The largest appropriations bill, which is the Defense Appropriations bill, will receive somewhere in the vicinity of $800-900 billion; the smallest, the Legislative Branch, will receive somewhere in the vicinity of $7 billion. The big fight is over whether the Defense Appropriations bill will be increased, and if so, whether non-defense spending will change by an equal amount.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For those of you who want to get even more into the weeds, this week I’ve restarted my much longer newsletter on Congress, the First Branch Forecast, which is focused on how power is wielded in Congress, improving the operations of the Legislative branch, and government transparency and accountability.

So today, we're talking committees!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Kinds of committees&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, it's important to know &lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/98-241"&gt;what kind of committee&lt;/a&gt; we're talking about. Standing committees are the ones that keep going over time. Except for the Ethics Committee, the majority party will always have enough members on a committee to pass what they prioritize. For example, &lt;a href="https://www.govtrack.us/congress/committees/HSJU"&gt;Judiciary&lt;/a&gt; currently has 24 Republicans and 19 Democrats. &lt;a href="https://ethics.house.gov/about/committee-members"&gt;Ethics&lt;/a&gt;, for obvious reasons, is evenly split between the majority and minority. However, even in the Ethics Committee, as with standing ones, the chair belongs to the majority and gets to wield considerable power. The chair is supposed to work with the Ranking Member (a member of the minority party), but they don't have to.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Shorter term committees with a specific purpose (aka "special" or "select"), like the January 6th Committee, are still set up in a broadly similar manner although the House Speaker can reject minority party members put forth by the Minority Leader. This happened with the January 6th Committee when then Speaker Pelosi rejected some, but not all of the members proposed by Minority Leader McCarthy. Even though she kept two Republicans, Pelosi's rejection of others is part of the reason many Republicans considered the whole thing illegitimate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Most standing committees have several subcommittees that are structured similarly and work in the same way as the main committee, but then when they finish their part, they bring their work and recommendations to the full committee for final action in this stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How are committee memberships assigned?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46806"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/R/R46786"&gt;House&lt;/a&gt; each have their own rules. Generally though, each party in each chamber establishes a steering committee to oversee the process and elections are held to see who the party overall wants on a given committee. Intra-party relationships play a big role here. If a member is not well liked or considered not a team player, it can hurt their prospects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;All of this holds true for chairships, but not covered in the CRS reports linked here is the role of contributions to leadership PACs. For example, &lt;a href="https://x.com/JakeSherman/status/1805960991634526419"&gt;Jake Sherman reported on June 26 on X&lt;/a&gt; that&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;@GReschenthaler announced he is transferring $1M to the NRCC. Reschenthaler is the chief deputy whip and has one eye on the Rules Committee chairmanship.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In other words, one way to demonstrate that one is a team player is to transfer some of one's own campaign funds the party leadership's fund to be used to help ensure wins for the party overall in the next election. In return, that member may be better positioned to become a committee chair.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;If this sounds like "pay to play" it's because it is. Is it bad? Hard to say. It certainly seems reasonable that party leadership would prioritize members who're willing to help keep seats even when those seats aren't their own. On the other hand, does fundraising prowess really demonstrate the necessary skills to lead a committee successfully? While the example above is for the Republicans, this role of contributions is equally strong among Democrats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;How are bills assigned to committees?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/the-legislative-process/introduction-referral"&gt;House website&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;The bill is assigned its legislative number by the Clerk and referred to the appropriate committee by the Speaker, with the assistance of the Parliamentarian.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/legislative-process/introduction-and-referral-of-bills"&gt;Senate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt; &lt;p&gt;... bills are typically referred to committee in a similar process, though in almost all cases, the bill is referred to only the committee with jurisdiction over the issue that predominates in the bill. In a limited number of cases, a bill might not be referred to committee, but instead be placed directly on the Senate Calendar of Business through a series of procedural steps on the floor.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What happens in committees?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;According to the &lt;a href="https://www.house.gov/the-house-explained/the-legislative-process/in-committee"&gt;House website&lt;/a&gt; the big picture is:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;hearing(s)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;markup which is a review of the legislation and possible addition of amendments&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;a committee report for the House as a whole or a vote to table (kill) the bill&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;if the bill is reported, it can have amendments -- sometimes so many amendments that the bill is rewritten and given a new number&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;then it's ready for the floor&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Per &lt;a href="https://www.congress.gov/legislative-process/committee-consideration"&gt;Congress dot gov&lt;/a&gt;, there are no real differences in Senate.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;What is a Conference Committee?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href="https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/RS/98-241#page+3"&gt;Conference Committee&lt;/a&gt; is what is required when the House and Senate each pass different versions of the "same" bill. This happens with appropriations a lot. Each chamber will add or subtract provisions they don't like and so each ends up passing something different. But only one bill can be sent to the President for signature and both chambers have to agree to that one bill.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;So, a Conference Committee is assigned. It's a joint committee in that there are members from both chamber on it. Leadership of each chamber select the members. Ideally, you'd anticipate members who are both knowledgable about the bill and good negotiators. However, like everything in Congress, popularity and leadership commitment to getting a final bill that can pass both chambers also play a role.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Once the final bill is sorted out, the committee is dissolved.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Next Week on Congress!&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Congress is back in session next week, so we'll be back to our usual schedule of previews and recaps. They're out again the week of the 15th so expect another mid-week mailbag then. Have a &lt;a href="https://www.cpsc.gov/Safety-Education/Safety-Education-Centers/Fireworks"&gt;safe Fourth of July&lt;/a&gt; everyone.&lt;/p&gt;      &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;hr&gt;  &lt;p&gt;    Let us know what you think about these updates    by tooting us on &lt;a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@GovTrack" title="Mastodon"&gt;&lt;i class="fab fa-mastodon"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; Mastodon&lt;/a&gt;    or &lt;a href="https://govtrack.us/contact" style="text-decoration: none"&gt;&lt;i class="fas fa-envelope"&gt;&lt;/i&gt; sending us an email&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;    			&lt;/div&gt;</description>
